For bringing home the charges prosecution has examined altogether 26prosecution witnesses and by referring the specific depositions tallying with concerned documentsprosecution has tried to impressed upon the Court that above said accused persons havingconspired with each other cheated Punjab & Sind Bank, Fatehpuri Branch, Delhi by fraudulentlyinducing the bank to disbursed / sanction/ obtained credit facility in the name of M/S GenxxChemicals Pvt Ltd, whose Managing Director was accused Jeevan Khanna.Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/819 It is further submitted on behalf of prosecution that on the basis of false / fabricated documentslike sale deed, valuation report etc M/S Genexx Chemicals Pvt Ltd was extended credit facilities tothe extend of Rs.165.62 lacs and for this purpose accused Jeevan Khanna being M.D of M/S GenexxChemicals submitted loan proposals requesting for sanction of working capital of Rs.25 lacs and C CNo.18/03 19/133 import L.C of Rs.100 lacs . Accused Shamsher Singh mortgage the sale deedknowing fully well major portion of mortgaged property was already sold . Accused V P Aneja whowas then working as bank's panel valuer submitted false / inflated valuation report showing thevalue of agricultural land situated at Rojkagujjar Tehsil, Sohana, Gurgaon to the extent of Rs.65.61lacs whereas there are evidence confirming the fact that said property was not more than Rs. 5 lacs .Accused Prateek Ratra being Director of M/S Genexx Chemicals Pvt Ltd was the authorisedsignatory of M/S Genexx Chemicals Pvt Ltd and he signed / executed the loan document, whichwere got processed by accused Hardeep Singh by use of illegal means and abusing his officialposition and subsequently accused Hardeep Singh in the capacity of Branch Manager of Punjab &Sind Bank, Fatehpuri Branch Delhi, on the basis of false and fabricated documents, disbursed/sanctioned the credit facility to the tune of Rs. 165.62 lacs in favour of M/S Genexx Chemicals PvtLtd. 20 In other words , accused Hardeep Singh in the capacity of public servant working as BranchManager of Punjab & Sind Bank, Fatehpuri Branch Delhi enabled accused Jeevan Khanna andPrateek Ratra to obtain pecuniary wrongful gain to the extent of Rs. 165.62 lacs causingcorresponding wrongful loss to Punjab & Sind C C No.18/03 20/133 Bank, Fatehpuri Branch. In thisway, prosecution has proved its case beyond the shadow of all reasonable doubts. Although Defencecounsel also got examined 11 Dws for rebutting the charges framed against accused persons but theirendeavor, if analyzed with the evidence in record, could not bring the consequences of high gravitywhich could support their stand in any way rather fortified the prosecution case impliedly as suchaccused persons may be hold guilty for the charges framed against them .DEFENCE ARGUMENTS 21 Sum and substance of the arguments of Ld Defence counsel for accusedHardeep Singh is that sanctioning authority had accorded sanction for his prosecution in amechanical manner without applying mind to all the relevant documents thus the same is bad,hence he cannot be prosecuted in this case; no preliminary inquiry has been conducted before theregistration of R C in question which is in violation of the rules, hence accused is entitle foracquittal; there is no evidence on the file to prove meeting of mind between accused Hardeep Singhcriminal conspiracy; accused Hardeep Singh had taken the C C No.18/03 21/133 title deed ofpaper have been taken out by someone in his absence and handed over to Jeevan Khanna; there isno evidence on the file to show that accused Hardeep Singh had obtained any pecuniary advantagein the alleged transaction thus no case U/S 13 (1) (d) of P C Act is made out accused is innocent, hemay be acquitted.22 In nutshell the arguments on behalf of accused Jeevan Khanna are that he is innocent; he hadGurgaon in the bank; it was a civil dispute ; Jeevan Khanna had taken loan from the bank on 2.3.98which he was regularly repaying thereafter limit was enhanced on 24.8.98 when accused allegedlydeposited the title deed in question thus accused was having no dishonest intention at the veryCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/9beginning i e on 2.3.98 to cheat the bank, therefore necessary ingredient of the offence of cheatingpunishable U/S 420 IPC are missing; bank has filed a suit for recovery against the accused which ispending in the DRT which again confirms that it was a civil dispute.23 Ld Defence counsel for accused Shamsher Singh has filed detailed written submission which areon the file therefore on C C No.18/03 22/133 account of brevity I am not reproducing his argumentsin this judgment however I will discuss his arguments at the appropriate stage.During pendency of this case accused V P Aneja expired on 9.10.2008 . CBI has confirmed thefactum of his death after verifying the same therefore present proceedings have been abated againsthim vide order dated 19.5.2009. Accused Pratik Ratra was discharged by the Hon'be High Courtvide order dated 3.05.2007.PUBLIC SERVANT AND SANCTION 24 Accused Hardeep Singh was the then posted as BranchManger in Punjab & Sind Bank, Fatehpuri Branch, thus, he was performing public function,therefore, was a public servant. Even during the course of argument accused has not disputed thisfact. In these circumstances, it is undisputed that accused Hardeep Singh was a public servant at therelevant time of commission of this offence. 25 PW 25 Sh. Manjeet Singh Sarang has deposed that Inthe month of December, 2003 he was General Manager working as Zonal Manager in the Zonaloffice of Punjab & Sindh Bank, Delhi.C C No.18/03 23/133 Accused Hardeep Singh was working as Branch Manager. By virtue of holdingthe post of General Manager, he was authority competent to remove Hardeep Singh from his post.After carefully perusing and examining the material including documents and statements ofwitnesses placed before him with regard to allegations and circumstances of this case, he wassatisfied and found the case prosecutable, therefore, he had accorded sanction for the prosecution ofHardeep Singh argued that sanctioning authority had accorded sanction without application ofmind. Granting of sanction is not an ideal formality or acrimonious exercise but a solemn andsacrosanct act which affords protection to government servants against frivolous prosecution andmust therefore be strictly complied with before any prosecution can be launched against the publicservant. Any case instituted without a proper sanction must fail. In support of his arguments he hasplaced reliance on S N Boss Vs State of Bihar AIR 1968 SC 1292 . He has further argued thatMansukh Lal V Chouhan Vs State of Gujrat 1997 7 SCC622. It is argued that Hon'ble Supreme Court has held that validity of sanction depends upon thematerial placed before the sanctioning authority and the fact that all the relevant facts, material andevidence C C No.18/03 24/133 have been considered by the sanctioning authority. The order ofother material placed before it. 27 Ld Defence counsel referred para No 27 of the charge sheet,alongwith original document will be filed after receipt of original documents." 28 It is argued thatthis charge sheet was filed in this Court on 24.12.2003 while sanction for the prosecution of accusedin this case Ex PW25/A was taken on 22.12.2003. It is argued that I O has deposed in his crossCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/10examination that he had filed only the relied upon documents in the Court alongwith the chargeNagar N Delhi given by Sh Roshan Lal given and valuation report of Sh Gurmej Singh dt 15.6.99He has also not relied upon the other legal opinion and valuation report and stated that the saiddocuments may be in the office of CBI or in the Malkhana of CBI. This clearly C C No.18/03 25/133shows that the IO had not produced all the documents before the sanctioning authority, in absenceof these documents, sanction has been granted. Had the sanctioning authority perused the recordcarefully, it would not have accorded sanction in this case. 29 It is argued that prosecution has notproduced any evidence as to what document and whose statement were forwarded to the competentauthority for accorded sanction . By suppressing the legal opinion and valuation report theprosecution did not bring to the knowledge of the sanctioning authority that the property was heldby Smt Neeta Khanna through papers such as GPA,Will etc and since she had not sale deed in herfavour no equitable mortage would have been created. The prosecution has also suppressed ExPW13/A from the perusal of sanctioning authority wherein the H.O ( Foreign Exchange ), RajenderNagar had directed that " additional facilities should be released only after effective mortgage isNeeta Khanna after fulfilling necessary formalities in consultation with bank's legal counsel. 30 It isfurther argued that the word "Effective Mortgage" is not used purposely because the head officeknows that Smt. Neeta C C No.18/03 26/133 Khanna had this property under GPA and no sale deedwas executed in her favour. If the higher officials wanted that the property should be equitablyproperty by deposit of title deed on the basis of legal opinion". 31 It is further argued that along withdated 08.06.99 where it was clearly written that as a gesture of goodwill, we hereby offered to youof Attorney in the name of Mrs. Neeta Khanna, approximately market value of Rs. 30 to 35 lacs.From 09.06.99 to 28.07.99 several meetings were held in the Zonal Office. 32 Ld. Defence Counselmortgage of the property by deposit of title deed on the basis of legal opinion and argued that itshows that sanction had been obtained after suppressing the material facts, i.e. the legal C Cthat the deposition of the sanctioning authority clearly exhibits that he was reluctant to answer thequestion but the fact remains that there was no suppression and of facts on behalf of Hardeep Singh.The Zonal office as well as the Head Office knows that the property is under GPA. It could beeffectively mortgaged according to the legal advise, hence they did not write that it should beequitably mortgaged. Hence, no wrong has been committed by Hardeep Singh, he was duty boundto send the proposal, if he thinks that the party has faced a genuine problem. Likewise, the ZonalOffice was also duty bound to send the proposal to the Head Office. 33 It is argued by Ld. DefenceCounsel that from the material collected/available on record, it is crystal clear that the decisiontaken was a collective one. The decision was required to be taken in the exigency of the situation.Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/11The decision to equitably mortgaged the property at Malviya Nagar was done in compliance of theorder of the higher authority and not for causing any wrongful gain to themselves or the borrower orfor causing wrongful loss to the bank.34        Ld. Defence Counsel in support of his arguments has placed C C  No.18/03                                                                  28/133 reliance on the following authorities: in two sheets having all relevant material particulars of this case.

After examining the documents placed before him and the statementof witnesses sanctioning authority reached to the conclusion that accused Hardeep Singh, the thenBranch Manager should be prosecuted in the competent court of law and accorded sanction for hisprosecution.37 PW 25 Manjeet Singh Sarang in his examination in chief in this regard has deposed as follows:Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/12" After perusing and carefully examining the material including documents and statements ofwitnesses placed before me with regard to allegations and circumstances of this case, when I becamesatisfied and found the case prosecutable I accorded the sanction for prosecution dated 22.12.2003,which bears my initial with official round seal at point A on first page and full signatures along withC C  No.18/03                                                                          30/133"It is wrong to suggest that CBI had sent a draft sanction order of Ex PW 25/A. It is correct that Ihave not mentioned in Ex PW 25/A as to which documents and statement of which witness I hadperused. Today I do not remember whose statement I had perused and which documents I had seenprior to passing of sanction order. At the time when I was General Manager as Incharge of ZonalOffice Hardeep Singh was Branch Manager in Regional Office. I do not remember where HardeepSingh was posted on 22nd December 2003. I do not remember whether even after this case accusedHardeep Singh was promoted and posted in various good branches. It is correct that monthly reportwas being sent by the Branch Manager to controlling office. I do not remember whether any lapsewas found in loan sanctioned by Hardeep Singh during my stay in Zonal office. I was not posted inZonal office at the time when the loan was sanctioned to M/s Genexx Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. Whateverthe lapse were committed by Hardeep Singh must be mentioned in Ex PW 25/A. I do not rememberwhether valuation report and legal opinion was with me when Ex PW 25/A was drafted. It must bein the file. By effective mortgage I mean mortgage of the property by deposit of title deed on thebasis of legal opinion. Now I do not remember how I written in Ex PW 25/A that Hardeep Singh was(Half portion of basement, New Delhi). Now I do not remember because of long lapse of time as onwhich basis I have mentioned in Ex PW 25/A the above line. Now I do not remember whether I hadMalviya Nagar was only on General Power of Attorney and cannot be equitably mortgaged and anegative lien can be created, I would not have sanction prosecution of the accused?Ans: I cannot say again said I do not remember.Now I do not remember as to how many days the file with regard to sanction of prosecution ofaccused remained with me. IO never met me. This file was received by me through my department. Ihad not heard any adverse remark against accused Hardeep Singh in my tenure. It is correct thatfrom 199 to 2003 accused Hardeep Singh had worked as branch Manager in different branches. Imust have perused the personal file of accused also. I had not heard whether accused has faced DECbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/13in any other case. It is wrong to suggest that I have given sanction for prosecution of accused underdisbelieve his deposition, thus, his deposition can be relied upon.deposition of sanctioning authority Sh. Manjeet Singh Sarang, it is clear that sanctioning authorityafter perusing, whatever documents produced before him and after going through the statements ofwitnesses had reached to the conclusion that accused should be prosecuted by a competent court oflaw and accorded the sanction for his prosecution, which was also prepared by sanctioning authorityhimself.C C  No.18/03                                                                     32/133 40        It is also proved on the file that sanctioning authority had not under:perused. Today I do not remember whose statement I had perused and which document I had seenprior to passing of sanction order".41 Granting of sanction for the prosecution of an accused rests upon the subjective satisfaction ofsanctioning authority. If the sanctioning authority after examining the statements of witnesses andwhatever documents produced before him reached to the conclusion after applying his mind thatauthority does not cause any damage.42        According to accused, GEQD opinion on some documents was C C  No.18/03                                                                        33/133awaited and some original documents were not placed before the sanctioning authority asmentioned in para no. 27 of chargesheet. It is a matter of experience that CBI send photocopies ofthe documents to the sanctioning authority for his perusal, CBI hardly send the original documentsto the sanctioning authority for his perusal. It has neither been asked from sanctioning authority nornot.Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/1443 Meticulous perusal of the exhibited documents like Ex PW21/K , Ex PW26/G, Ex PW26/H, Exreasons for opinion entry made at page 41 of title deed register and specimen hand writing of ShHardeep Singh surfaced the fact that Defence counsel in his arguments by referring the factmentioned in charge sheet relating to "GEQD opinion and some documents awaited and the samealongwith original documents will be filed after receipt of original documents." In fact the opinion in15.10.2003 Ex PW 21/K from GEQD which is much prior to filing of charge sheet dated 24.12.2003,on the basis of which sanction dated 22.12.2003 Ex PW25/A was accorded by C C No.18/03 34/133Sanctioning authority. Therefore, it is clear that the plea of defence on this count is meritless ratherevidence and other material placed before him before according sanction for prosecution.44 Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kalpanath Rai v. State(through CBI), (1997 (8) SCC 732), hasobserved by this Court that the sanctioning authority is not required to wait for the report of theexperts. The sanctioning authority has only to see whether the facts disclosed in the complaintprima facie disclose commission of an offence or not. The actual production of the tapes etc., arematters for proof during trial and not necessarily to be undertaken at this stage. It is true ascontended by learned counsel for respondent No.1, grant of sanction is not empty formality.45 It is not for the sanctioning authority to judge the truth of the allegations made against theaccused by calling for the records of the case. It is enough if he goes through all the relevant papers(Indu Bhushan Chatterjee V. State of West Bengal, AIR 1958 SC 148 Cr. LJ279) C C No.18/0335/133 46 Hon'ble Supreme Court in Shiv Raj Singh Vs Delhi Administration AIR 1968 SC 1419, inthis regard has held as follows:" Where the order of sanction shows on the face of it what were the facts constituting the offencecharged and that a prima facie case was made out against the accused and the order further recitesthat the sanctioning authority " after fully and carefully examining the material before him in regardto the aforesaid allegations in the case, considers that a prima facie case is made against theaccused" the order fulfill the requirement of Sec 6 of the Prevention of Corruption Act."47 In this regard, Hon'ble Supreme Court in Superintendent of police (CBI) Vs. Deepak Chaudhary -1995 SCC (Crl.) 1095 has held as follows:''We find force in the contention. The grant of sanction is only an administrative function, though itis true that the accused may be saddled with the liability to be prosecuted in a court of law. What ismaterial at that time is that the necessary facts collected during investigation constituting theoffence have to be placed before the sanctioning authority and it has to consider the material.constitute the offence C C No.18/03 36/133 and then either grant or refused to grant sanction. Thegrant of sanction, therefore, being administrative act the need to prove an opportunity of hearing tothe accused before according sanction does not arise. The High Court, therefore, was clearly in errorCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/15in holding that the order of sanction is vitiated by violation of the principles of natural justice.'' 48Hon'ble Supreme Court in Kottha Perumal Vs. State Tr. Inspector of Police, Vigilance and AntiCorruption, AIR 2011 Supreme Court 356 has held as follows:material facts by sanctioning authority - Sanction order specifically stating that statement ofwitnesses have been duly examined - Other materials such as copy of FIR as well as other officialwitnesses as also material on record, sanctioning authority has duly recorded its satisfaction thatappellant should be prosecuted - Sanction order is legal". 49 Hon'ble Supreme Court has held thatwhere the sanction order itself is a speaking order in such circumstances, it is not necessary to proveit by leading evidence that sanctioning authority has applied his due mind. Reliance is placed on C SKrishnamurthy Vs. State of Karnataka 2005 IV AD (S.C.) 141 wherein in para No.9 it is observed asfollows:C C No.18/03 37/133 "Therefore, the ratio is sanction order should speak for itself and in case thefacts do not so appear, it should be proved by leading evidence that all the particulars were placedbefore the sanctioning authority for due application of mind. In case the sanction speaks for itselfthen the satisfaction of the sanctioning authority is apparent by reading the order. In the presentcase, the sanction order speaks for itself that the incumbent has to account for the assetsdisproportionate to his known source of Incom. That is contained in the sanction order itself. Moreso, as pointed out, the sanctioning authority has come in the witness box as witness No.40 and hasdeposed about his application of mind and after going through the reports of the Superintendent ofPolice, CBI and after discussing the matter with his legal department, he accorded sanction. It is nota case that the sanction is lacking in the present case. The view taken by the Additional SessionsJudge is not correct and the view taken by learned Single Judge of the High Court is justified". 50Though from the above discussion, it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that there is no nonapplication of mind by sanctioning authority and the sanction order accorded by him for theprosecution of accused in this case without perusing the GEQD report and some of the originalof PC Act, 1988, accused has to show a failure of justice has been caused because of any error,omission or irregularity in the sanction order.C C No.18/03 38/133 "(a) No finding, sentence or order passed by a special judge shall be reversedor altered by the court in appeal, confirmation or revision on the ground of the absence of, or anyopinion of that court a failure of justice has in fact occasioned thereby";51 Explanation given in section 19 of PC Act, 1988 in this regard is as under:(a) error includes competency of the authority to grant sanction.Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/1652 In this case accused has not shown as to what prejudice has been caused to him.53 Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ashok Tshering Bhutia V. State of Sikkim, AIR 2011 SUPREMECOURT 1363 in this regard has held as follows:failure of justice".It is further observed as follows in para no. 12 of this authority: " Same remained the positionregarding sanction. In the absence of anything to show that any defect or irregularity therein causeda failure of justice, the plea is without substance. A failure of justice is relatable to error, omission orirregularity in the sanction. Therefore, a mere error, omission or irregularity in sanction is notconsidered to be fatal unless it has resulted in a failure of justice or has been occasioned thereby.Section 19 (1) of the PC Act, 1988 is a matter of procedure and does not go to the root of thejurisdiction and once the cognizance has been taken by the Court under Cr. P.C., it cannot be saidthat an invalid police report is the foundation of jurisdiction of the court to take cognizance. ( VideKalpnath Rai (supra); State of Orissa v.

It was contended by accused persons that the obtaining of evidence in any of these waysammounted to compelling the person accused of an offence "to be a witness against himself" incontravention of Article 20 (3) of the Constitution.

Uttar Pradesh AIR 1973 SC 2200 wherein it is held as follows:"Both under Section 45 and Section 47 the evidence is an opinion in the former by a scientificcomparison, and in the latter on the basis of familiarity resulting from frequent observatrions andexperience. in either case the Court must satisfy itself by such means as are open that the opinionmay be acted upon. One such means open to the Court is to apply its own observation to theadmitted or proved writings and to compare them with the disputed one, not to become ahandwriting expert but to verify the premises of the expert in the one case and to appraise the valueof the opinion in the other case. This comparison depends on an analysis of the characterstics in theadmitted or proved writings and the finding of the same characterstics in large measure in thedisputed writing. In this way the opinion of the deponent whether expert or other is subjected toscrutiny and although relevant to start with becomes probative. Where an expert's opinion is given,the Court must see for itself and with the C C No.18/03 46/133 assistance of the expert come to itsown conclusion whether it can safely be held that the two writings are by the same person.

Law Journal 810 comparing the evidence given by a Govt. examiner and a privateHandwriting Expert has held that a private expert has a natural tendency to support the view of theperson who had called him. The evidence of Govt. examiner is more reliable in such circumstances.Relevant portion of Para no. 17 of this authority is as under:"Looking to the statements of these experts, proving their expert opinion, we prefer to depend onQuestioned Documents. It is more satisfactory and satisfying. It is more reasonable and dependable.It is more scientific as compared to the opinion of Sh. N K Jain (DW1), which is not so thorough andconvincing. It is neither reasoned nor satisfactory. There is natural tendency on the part of theexpert to support the view of the person who had called him. It can, therefore, be said that there issufficient material on the record for coming to the conclusion that the accused were conspiring witheach other and the object of conspiracy was not only the family of Jai Paul but also the deceased". 71In view of above discussion this court is of opinion that specimen writings/signatures of accused inthis case were legally taken by the IO during the investigation which were used by PW 26 Sh T Joshi,Handwriting Expert for comparing with the questioned writings/signatures.

He undertakes not to dispose off the assets or create charge on it without thepermission of the creditor/banker.In Equitable mortgage the borrower or the debtor deposit the title deed of the property and wherebycreates a charge over it as a security to the bank.Negative lien does give the right to the bank to take possession of the property without theintervention of the Court but at the same time the borrower is under obligation not to dispose of theproperty or create any charge on it".FACTUAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF DEFENCE ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF ACCUSEDHARDEEP SINGH 106 It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that in this case no C C No.18/03 69/133preliminary enquiry has been conducted before the registration of RC which is in violation of theRules. In support of his arguments, Ld. Defence Counsel placed reliance on Para No. 6 of AshokTshering Bhutia Vs. State of Sikkim, AIR, 2011 SC 1363. I have carefully gone through this authority.Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/29In the beginning of paragraph no.6, it is observed that there must be some suitable preliminaryenquiry into the allegations by a responsible officer. In the end of this paragraph, it is observed asfollows:" However, as the issued is being raised first time before this Court, it is not worth furtherconsideration. More so, the aforesaid observation do not lay down law of universal application."107 Thus Hon'ble Supreme court in this para itself has clarify that to hold preliminary inquiry beforeregistration of a regular case is not necessary/compulsory.108 Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ramesh Kumari Vs State 2006 Crl L J 1622 has observed as follows:Concerned officer is duty bound to register case on basis of information disclosing cognizableoffence.It is further held as follows:" The views expressed by this Court in paragraphs 31, 32 and 33 as quoted above leave no mannersof doubt that the provision of Section 154 of the Code is mandatory and the concerned officer is dutybound to register the case on the basis of such an information disclosing cognizable offence." 109 Itis argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that it is absolutely wrong that accused Hardeep Singh granted theCC limit of Rs. 10 lacs and LC of Rs. 1 crore to M/s Genexx Chemicals Pvt.

However, looking to the scope and potential of the branch, Mr. G S Duggal Branch ManagerCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/3026.08.2003. I had stated to the CBI that earlier Branch Manager of Fatehpuri Branch was given114 In view of above discussion I fully agree with the argument of Ld. Defence Counsel in this regardC C  No.18/03                                                                              72/133 115       It is argued by ld. Defence Counsel that there is no evidence to show that accused had hatched a criminal conspiracy to cheat the bank. In support of his arguments,Ld. Defence Counsel has placed reliance on following authorities:P.K. Narayan Vs. State of Kerala (1995) 1 SCC 142 wherein it is held that an offence of conspiracycannot be deemed to have been established on mere suspicion and surmises and inferences whichare not supported by cogent evidence.State of M.P Vs. Sheetal Sahai & Ors. 2009 VIII AD (SC) 630 wherein it is held that criminalconspiracy is an independent offence. It is punishable separately. Prosecution therefore, for thepurpose of bringing the charge of criminal conspiracy read with the provisions of PC Act wasrequired to establish the offence by applying the same legal principle which are otherwise applicablefor the purpose of bringing criminal misconduct on the part of an accused. It is necessary to showmeeting of minds of two or more persons for doing or causing to be done an illegal act by an illegalmeans.116       It is argued that accused Hardeep Singh had no knowledge that C C  No.18/03                                                              73/133the persons who have been introduced in the bank by the second man of the branch had anintention to defraud the bank and they are providing the property papers after selling the propertyto others. Hardeep Singh cannot be blamed if the property papers have been taken out by someone,in his absence and handed over to Sh. Jeevan Khanna. Hardepp singh also cannot be blamed, if adocument has been inserted in the record behind his back. Unless there is evidence to show that theaccused/Manager had knowledge of the intention on the part of Jeevan Khanna and S S Ahlawat, hecannot be said to have committed any misconduct as alleged by the prosecution. No evidence hasbeen led by the prosecution to prove the complicity of Hardeep Singh with Jeevan Khanna and S SAhlawat. There is also no allegation that Hardeep Singh had taken any bribe in the entireCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/31transaction. Till date there is no evidence showing any pecuniary gain to Hardeep Singh.Prosecution has failed to prove any wrongful loss to the bank or any wrongful gain attained by theaccused Hardeep Singh. Prosecution has also failed to prove any abuse of official position byHardeep Singh. There is positive evidence that Hardeep Singh is a hardworking, honest and sincerebank official and no one has ever received any complaint against him.117                 With regard to appreciation of circumstantial evidence C C  No.18/03                                                                  74/133and its sufficiency in a criminal conspiracy of committed cheating, combined effect of all the provedfacts taken together for establishing the criminal conspiracy conclusively in this regard it is held byAct (1 of 1872), S.3 - Criminal P.C. (5 of 1898), S.367 - Penal Code (45 of 1860), S.120B, S.419 andS.420 - Appreciation of evidence - Circumstantial evidence, sufficiency of - If combined effect of allproved facts taken together is conclusive in establishing guilt of accused, conviction would bejustified even though anyone or more of these facts by itself is not decisive - Held on facts andcircumstances that charges under Sections 120B and 420, IPC have been established against all thefour accused and under Section 419, IPC against accused No. 3". 118 In this regard in Ram Avtarconsignment against the partners of the consignee firm on the ground that by misrepresentationand deceit the partners of the consignee firm induced the carriers to deliver the consignment tothem without retiring the transport receipt from the bank and without making payment to the Bankas required by the contract was quashed by the High Court on C C No.18/03 75/133 feeling that theconsignee had later on in three installments paid both the freight and the price and as such it was acase of mere delay in discharge of monetary liability which need not necessarily amount to dishonestintention on their part, but it was found that the carriers had in fact settled all the dues of theconsignors and the consignees even after getting delivery of the consignment from the carriersallegedly by making misrepresentation and practising deceit have failed to make good a substantialpart of the price of the goods the order of the High Court was quashed by Supreme Court".119 Conspiracy consists in a combination or agreement between two or more person to do anunlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. A conspiracy is an inference drawn from thecircumstances. There cannot always be much direct evidence about it. Conspiracy can be inferredeven from the circumstances giving rise to a conclusive or irresistible inference of an agreementbetween two or more persons to commit an offence. Since Conspiracy is often hatched up in utmostsecrecy, it is most impossible to prove conspiracy by direct evidence. It has to be inferred from theacts, statements and conduct of parties to the conspiracy. Thus, if it is proved that the accusedpursued, by their acts, the same object often by the same means, one performing one part of the actand the other another part of the same act so as to C C No.18/03 76/133 complete it with a view toattainment of the object which they were pursuing, the court is at liberty to draw the inference thatCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/32they conspired together to effect that object. Conspiracy has to be treated as a continuing offenceand whosoever is a party to the conspiracy, during the period for which he is charged, is liable underthis section.120 It is not an ingredient of the offence under this section that all the parties should agree to do asingle illegal act. It may comprise the commission of a number of acts. The entire agreement mustbe viewed as a whole and it has to be ascertain as to what in fact the conspirators intended to do orthe object they want to achieve. It is not necessary that each member of conspiracy must know eachother or all the details of the conspiracy. It is also not necessary that every conspirator must havetaken place in each and every act done in pursuance of a conspiracy. 121 Though to establish thecharge of conspiracy there must be agreement, there need not be proof of direct meeting orcombination , nor need the parties be brought into each other's presence; the agreement may beinferred from the circumstances raising presumption of a common concerted plan to carry out theunlawful design. Conspiracy need not be established by proof which actually brings the partytogether; but may be shown like any other fact, by circumstantial evidence. So again it is notnecessary that all should have joined in the scheme from the first point; those who come in at a laterstage are equally guilty.C C  No.18/03                                                                  77/133 122                 Conspiracy hatched in secrecy and executed in darkness. In a case of conspiracy, it is not expected from the prosecution that it will produce evidence to showthat conspirators executed agreement to commit crime before the witnesses to prove the existence ofconspiracy. Conspirators take all precautions to keep their plan secret hence prosecution cannotproduce direct evidence to prove agreement to commit conspiracy.123 In Kher Singh Vs State AIR 1988 SC 1883 it is observed as follows:" Generally, a conspiracy is hatched in secrecy and it may be difficult to adduce direct evidence ofthe same. The prosecution will often rely on th evidence of acts of various parties to infer that theywere done in reference to their common intention. The prosecution will also more often rely uponthe circumstantial evidence. The conspiracy can be undoubtedly proved by such evidence direct orcircumstantial. But the Court must require whether the two persons are independently pursuing thesame end or they have come together to the pursuit of the unlawful object. The former does notrender them conspirators, but the later does. It is however, essential that the offence of conspiracyrequired some kind of physical manifestation or agreement the express agreement however need notbe proved. Nor mutual meetings of the two persons is necessary. Nor it is necessary to prove theactual words of communication. The evidence as to transmission of thoughts C C No.18/03 78/133sharing the unlawful design may be sufficient. Conspiracy can be proved by circumstances and othermaterial."124 In a case of criminal conspiracy any evidence available against any of the accused is admissibleagainst all the accused. Once a conspiracy is proved among the accused, act of one conspiratorbecome act of all other conspirators also. In this regard Ld. SPP placed reliance on Shiv NarainCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/33Laxmi Narain Joshi Vs State of Maharashtra, (1980 ) 2 Supreme Court Cases 465 has held asfollows:the offence can only be proved largely from the inference drawn from acts or illegal omissions10." 125 Hon'ble Supreme Court in Firozuddin Basheeruddin & Ors. Vs. State of Kerala, (2001) 7Supreme Court Cases 596 has held as follows:"Conspiracy is not only a substantive crime but on the basis of it a conspirator can also be held liableregards admissibility of evidence strict standards are not necessary inasmuch as any declarationmade by a conspirator in furtherance of and during pendency of a conspiracy though hearsay, isconcurrent finding that criminal conspiracy proved and on the basis offence of murder also madeout not called for." 126 Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ram Naryan Popli Vs. CBI AIR 2003, SC 2748 hasheld as follows:"The essential ingredient of the offence of criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit anoffence. In a case where the agreement is for accomplishment of an act which by itself constitutes anoffence, then in that event no overt act is necessary to be proved by the prosecution because in sucha situation, criminal conspiracy is established by proving such an agreement. Where the conspiracyalleged is with regard to commission of a serious crime of the nature as contemplated in Sectionagreement between the accused for commission of such a crime alone is enough to bring about aor by any one of them would not be necessary."127 Hon'ble Supreme Court in P K Narayan Vs. State of Kerala, All India Criminal Law Reporter1994 (3) 785, has held as follows:of Criminal conspiracy - It is an agreement to do an illegal act - Agreement can be proved either bydirect evidence or by circumstantial evidence or by both- Complicity of the accused - Circumstances proved before, during and after the occurrence requiredcompatible with the innocence of the accused persons then it could not be held that the prosecutionhad successfully established its case."Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/34128 Hon'ble Supreme Court in S. Swamirathnam, Appellant Vs. State of Madras, Respondent, (s)AIR 1957 S.C. 340 in this regard has held as follows:"If a specific instance of cheating was proved beyond C C No.18/03 81/133 doubt against any of theaccused that would furnish the best corroboration of the offence of conspiracy because conspiracywas the root and the specific instances were the fruit." 129 In the case in hand accused JeevanKhanna had initially filed forged/fabricated Roznamcha entry No. 634 PW10/1 dated 20.12.97 ,which was accepted by accused Hardeep Singh. He had also accepted property of accused ShamsherSingh as collateral security which was purchased by him on 19.3.96 vide Sale deed Ex PW1/B invalue cannot be increased by 39 folds within a period of about one and half year by any stretch ofimagination. It proves that accused Jeevan Khanna was acting from the very beginning invaluation report of this property and Roznamcha Entry 634 Ex PW10/A, moreover bank hadsanctioned credit limit of Rs.110 lacs but in the above referred Roznamcha lien mark for Rs.80 lacsonly. Accused Hardeep Singh should have confirmed from the concerned authority in this regardbefore disbursement of the loan. which again proves his involvement in criminal conspiracy with hissaid property. Sh. Shamsher Singh Ahlawat had already sold 4 bigha land to Sh. D N Verma andSingh Ahlawat dishonestly and fraudulently handed over/deposited the original sale deed datedalready sold 8 bigha and 16 biswa land to other persons and thereby helped Jeevan Khanna infurtherance of the criminal conspiracy in connivance with Hardeep Singh to cheat the bank andcaused wrongful pecuniary gain to accused Jeevan Khanna and wrongful loss to the bank. 131 At thetime of enhancement of loan facilities, accused Jeevan Khanna had created equitable mortgage ofpurchased by Jeevan Khana from Smt. Suneet Prabha Arora W/o Satpal Arora on 10.04.98 and thesaid plot was transferred in the name of Jeevan Khanna on 13.05.98. Further Jeevan Khannaapplied C C No.18/03 83/133 in Estate Office HUDA to grant necessary permission to sell the sameplot on 02.11.98. Estate Office HUDA granted necessary permission to Jeevan Khanna vide theirletter No. 4094 dated 03.11.98 and Jeevan Khanna sold the said plot to Sh. Sunil Kumar Gupta R/oof Shri Sunil Kumar Gupta on 31.12.98.132 From the above discussion it is proved that accused Jeevan Khanna was having dishonestintention to cause wrongful loss to the bank and wrongful gain to himself from the very beginningwhen he had deposited the forged and fabricated Roznamcha entry no. 634 with the bank along withthe title deed of the property of accused Shamsher Singh as collateral security, major part of whichwas already sold. Dishonest intention of accused Jeevan Khanna is also proved at the time ofCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/35enhancement of the sanction limit when he had furnished the additional collateral security ofKumar Gupta.133 From the above discussion prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that accusedHardeep Singh, Jeevan Khanna and C C No.18/03 84/133 Shamsher Singh were acting inconnivance with each other and involved in this criminal conspiracy and they have cheated the bankin furtherance of criminal conspiracy in collusion with each other . 134 It is correct that there is noevidence on the file that accused Hardeep Singh had obtained any pecuniary gain for himself.However, it is apparent that accused Hardeep Singh by his act and conduct and in connivance withJeevan Khanna abusing his official position . Obtaining pecuniary gain/ advantage for himself is notthe only ingredient of Section 13 (1) (d) of P C Act 1988 . If an accused by corrupt and illegal means,then he is liable to commit an offence defined U/S 13 (1) (d) of P C Act 1988.

Defence Counsel that the accused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat is innocent, has committed no offence and has been framed in the case to provide amissing link in the prosecution case in which the prosecution has miserably failed from evidencepresented by themselves.156 Accused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat is connivance with Jeevan Khanna and Hardeep Singhoffered/mortgaged his property situated at Rojka Gujjar against the credit facilities, i.e. CC ( BookDebts) Rs. 10 lacs and letter of credit Rs. 100 lacs sanctioned to M/s Gennex Checicals Pvt.

Entry of Equitable mortgage of Jeevanavailable in the bank.157 It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that the only allegation against the accused is that heallegedly stood as Guarantor and he offered his land as collateral security concealing the fact thatthe land C C No.18/03 98/133 offered through submission of a registered sale deed stood alreadysold. This allegation of becoming guarantor and offering collateral security is in respect of some loanKhanna to whom as per allegations the Punjab and Sind Bank Ltd.

Defence  Counsel   that   the  most  relevant C C  No.18/03                                                                   99/133Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/41exposed the falsities of allegation against the accused whereas PW 8 says that for number 84AA wasgot executed by him in March 1998 by which time the valuation report from Panel Advocate of thebank was not received. The sale deed in original according to PW8 was allegedly submitted by theaccused and the sale deed was dated March1996 and in March 1998, the valuation of the land isbeing shown as Rs. 65 lacs few thousands. When Sale deed in original is available the considerationamount on which the land was purchased must be in the sale deed and therefore and high claimthan that could not have been possibly entertained by the bank.160 Accused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat is trying to mix up the matter. Punjab and Sind Banksanctioned the credit facilities of CC ( Book debts) Rs. 10 lacs and Letter of credit Rs. 100 lacssanctioned to M/s Genex Chemicals Pvt. Ltd by Punjab and Sindh Bank, Fatehpuri Branch duringFebruary, 1998 against property of Shamsher Singh Ahlawat situated at Rojka, Gujjar, Tehsil Sohna,Gurgaon, Haryana.

Equitable mortgage in this regard was created in bankC C No.18/03 100/133 by receiving the sale deed of said property and entry of the same mentionedon the request of Jeevan Khanna in August, 1998 against the equitable mortgage of accusedShamsher Singh property situated at Rojka Gujjar, the Sohna, Gurgaon which is already mortgagedreleased in January, 1999. All the directors of M/s Genex Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. Executed the loanamount of credit facilities sanctioned to M/s Genex Chemicals have been changed. However, theoriginal property documents of Shamsher Singh Ahlawat was already with bank, hence no entry washis deposition. 161 It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that in the charges framed, it is clearlymentioned that the accused had offered land for mortgage by submitting the sale deed in question9/25. The prosecution failed to explain as to which one is the correct declaration inform 84 AA. Ifthe sale deed was deposited in March 1998, was it returned to the accused Shamsher Singh withoutloan having been liquidated otherwise how the same sale deed could have been possibly redepositedor deposited in January 1999.162 Accused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat is trying to mix two instances. As stated in above paras firstlacs and letter of credit Rs. 100 lacs sanctioned to M/s Genex Chemicals Pvt. Ltd. By Punjab andSind Bank, Fatehpuri Branch during February, 1998. The amount mentioned in the said form is Rs.One crore.

Inthe said form sanctioned amount was mentioned as CC Rs.25 lacs and LC Rs. 70 lacs. However, theoriginal property documents of Shamsher Singh Ahlawat was already with bank, hence no entry wasmade in the Equitable Mortgage Register at this time. If the accused had not executed the fresh form84AA, the same would create problem to bank in further proceedings, if loanee and guarantor failedto repay the loan.163 It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that the CBI had produced palpably false and liar witnessesagainst the accused and their statement makes the case false and fabricated against the accused .9/25". In cross examination by the counsel on behalf of accused Shamsher Singh, he has admittedthat he has not seen the original documents of the property. He has further stated that he cannot say103/133 connection with sanction of limit loan involved in this case neither Shamsher Singh came inthe bank before me nor he has signed any document before me". There can be no serious lie thanthis when in examination in chief he admits that accused Shamsher Singh signed in his presenceand in cross he gives a clean goodbye to his previous statement that Shamsher Singh never came toBank before him nor he signed any document before him. This shows the falsity of the CBI witnessesagainst the accused.Ahlawat in his presence. The original documents had already been submitted by Shamsher SinghAhlawat vide form No. 84AA dated 03.03.1998 against the facility of CC (Book debts) Rs. 10 lacs andLetter of credit Rs. 100 lacs and entry of receipt of sale deed was made in the Equitable Mortgageaccused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat that " It is incorrect to suggest that C C No.18/03 104/133Counsel that at least from the statement of PW1, it is clear that till March 1998 the accused had soldonly 8 Bighas and 16 Biswas out of the land of which sale deed was allegedly submitted in the bankand therefore, when the sale seed was for the purchase of 10 Bighas and 13 Biswas clearly about twoBighas was with the accused Shamsher Singh.

Defence Counsel that no deed of mortgage has been produced in the court atany stage executed by accused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat mortgaging his land.168 Equitable mortgage is created in the bank by depositing the original papers of property. Theentry regarding deposit of original papers is made in the Equitable Mortgage Register. AccusedShamsher Singh Ahlawat had deposited the property documents situated at Rojka Gujjar, TehsilHardeep Singh, Branch Manager. 169 It is argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that in the plaint Ex.DW5/A at page 8 in para 3, the Punjab and Sind Bank has claimed that respondent no. 2 to 7 hadsigned the letter of Guarantee in C C No.18/03 106/133 favour of the Bank and accused ShamsherSingh has been named as respondent no. 5 and therefore, as per claim of the bank there must beletter of Guarantee duly executed by Shamsher Singh, but then where is the letter of Guaranteewhich has not been produced in court during trial.credit facilities of CC Rs. 25 lacs and Letter fo credit Rs. 70 lacs sanctioned to M/s Genex Chemicalsloan sanctioned to M/s Genex Chemicals Pvt. Ltd.171 It is further argued by Ld. Defence Counsel that the accused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat is in nohaving any connection in their profession/business and the prosecution also could not lead anytherefore charges under section 120 B and 420 IPC against the accused must fail. In this connectiontheir are repeated decisions of C C No.18/03 107/133 Supreme Court that there should be someevidence of agreement before accepting the involvement of any person in criminal conspiracy.172 For the reasons discussed in this judgment role played by accused Shamsher Singh Ahlawat inconspiracy with Jeevan Khanna and Hardeep Singh to cheat Punjab & Sind Bank and to obtainedpecuniary gain to Jeevan Khanna is clearly established.

He has also mentioned in the letter that party has good past track .The relevant portion of thisletter is as follows:" With a sole view to revive, the party has come up with the proposal to open another front i e byimporting U S Plasma from Kamada Ltd of Israel. The copy of the contract/ proforma invoice of thesaid party is enclosed herewith for your ready reference. The party has requested us to establishedimport LC amounting to US $ 147668 ( Rs 63.94 lacs approximately ) on 120 days from date of AWBbasis without paying any magin at the time of opening of LC . They have instead offered the same atthe time opening release order from us on arrival of consignment. They have also offered another35 lacs in addition to the existing two properties held with us valued at Rs.79.82 lacs .As far s their past track record of dealing with us , we very proudly submit that they have neverdefaulted and honoured their obligation on respective due dates. The party has so far availed ImportLC's worth Rs.275.02 lacs from Sept 97 to till date . Out of the above figures the party just could notmake full payment of Lcs amounting to Rs.56.37 lacs due to reasons cited above.

In these circumstances hisrecommending of opening of LC without any margin money also proves his dishonest intention.Hardeep Singh has also informed Zonal Manager that the party has also offered another collateralNo.18/03 118/133 lacs in addition to the existing two properties held with the bank. Hardeep Singhdishonestly and fraudulently concealed the fact that Jeevan Khanna has already sold the property,recommending the opening of fresh LC on behalf of M/S Genex Pvt Ltd. Thus accused HardeepSingh has concealed this fact malafidely that HUDA vide letter dt 28.4.99 had informed that JeevanKhanna has sold the plot to Sunil Kumar therefore bank lien cannot created on this property.him to allow to open import L C of USD 1.48 lacs which should be released only after createdSingh that no LC is devolved and C C No.18/03 119/133 existing overdue outstanding on the accountof devolve Lcs is to be adjusted at the earliest and to closely monitor the account.

It also shows that accused Hardeep Singh had blindly accepted the valuation report ofthis property and Roznamcha Entry 634 Ex PW10/A, moreover bank had sanctioned credit limit ofRs.110 lacs but in the above referred Roznamcha lien mark for Rs.80 lacs only. Accused HardeepSingh should have confirmed from the concerned authority in this regard before disbursement ofthe bank.FACTUAL AND LEGAL ANALYSIS OF DEFENCE ARGUMENTS ON BEHALF OF ACCUSEDJEEVAN KHANNA.C C  No.18/03                                                          121/133 193       Ld Defence counsel for accused Jeevan Khanna argued that he deed / documents of this property in the bank. Ld Defence counsel further argued that accused hasnot furnished the title documents in the bank that is why the same are not available in the bank . Asdiscussed above accused Jeevan Khanna himself filed his affidavit Ex PW9/DD wherein he hasdeposed that he had furnished the title deed/ document of this property as collateral security andhanded over the same to the bank. Accused Jeevan Khanna has also mentioned in form 84AAexecuted by him under his signatures with regard to furnishing of this property as collateral security. In these circumstances, there is no merit in this argument.194 Ld Defence counsel has argued that initially loan facilities were granted to accused JeevanKhanna on 2.3.98 thereafter the limit was enhanced on 24.8.98. There was no complaint wef 2.3.98to 24.8.98 . Ld Defence counsel further argued that in a case of cheating dishonest intention to cheatshould exist from the very beginning but in this case there was no such dishonest intention from thevery beginning hence no offence of cheating punishable U/S 420 IPC is made out. Bank has alreadyfiled a suit for recovery against C C No.18/03 122/133 accused Jeevan Khanna which is pendingbefore the DRT. It is argued that at the most it was a civil dispute but the CBI has malafidelyconverted it in a criminal case. In support of his argument Ld Defence counsel placed reliance on thefollowing authorities:Gopalakrishnan Vs State by Sub Inspector of Police , Tiruthani (1994) 3 Crimes 274Hatiram Naik Vs Surendra Kumar Malik ( 1986) Cr L J 1271.Hari Prasad Chamaria Vs Bishun Kumar Surekha AIR 1974 SC 301.A K Khosla Vs T S Venkatesan 1992 Cr L J 1448 Hari Sao Vs The State of Bihar AIR1970 SC 843 State of Maharashtra Vs Syndicate Transport Co (P) Ltd AIR 1964Bombay 195.Cbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/50Jageshwar Singh Rastogi Vs State of M P AIR 1980 SC Vinar Ltd & Ors Vs ChenabTextiles Mills 1989 Cr L J 1858.George Zacharia @ Raju Kanuvamplakka Vs T K Varghese & Ars 1994 AIR SCW4884.C C  No.18/03                                                                 123/133 195       I have carefully gone through all the authorities. There is no dispute with the ratio of law laid down in these authorities, however, ratio of law laiddown in a particular authority according to its own peculiar facts and circumstances.Ratio of law laid down in a particular authority may not be applicable in the facts andcircumstances of other case.          The  ingredients of offence of cheating are           1         Deception of any person           2         (a) Fraudulently or dishonest inducing that person:                    (i)       to deliver any property to any person or                    (i)       to consent that any person shall retain any                               property or                     (b)        intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived, and which actor omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind,reputation or property.196 Intention is the gist of offence, the person cheated must have been intentionally intended to doan act which he would not have done or to omit to do an act which he would have done, owing to C CNo.18/03 124/133 deception practiced on him. The intention at the time of the offence and theconsequences of the act or omission itself have to be considered. To hold a person guilty of cheatingit is necessary to show that he had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making thepromise.197 The distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine one. Itdepends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by hissubsequent conduct. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution U/s 420 IPC,unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction i.e. theCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/51time when the offence is said to have been committed. 198 Intention is defined as the purpose ordesign with which an act is done. Intention is an internal state of mind. Sometime it may beexpressed sometime it may be implied. Implied intention is to be inferred from the acts andconducts of the parties . It is on the principle that every man knows the consequences of his act orconduct. If the consequences are foreseen as the certain results of the doer acts, it shall be taken asintended. Sometimes the intention is imputed from the act or the consequences. If a particular acthas been C C No.18/03 125/133 done, the law will presume that the person doing it has the intentionto do it without the enquiry as to whether actually he had the intention or not.199 In the case in hand accused Jeevan Khanna had initially filed forged/fabricated Roznamchaentry No. 634 PW10/1 dated 20.12.97 , which was accepted by accused Hardeep Singh. He had alsoaccepted property of accused Shamsher Singh as collateral security which was purchased by him onPW10/A dated 20.12.97 its value has been shown as 80 lacs . This property was purchased onabout one and half year by any stretch of imagination. It proves that accused Jeevan Khanna waswho had blindly accepted the valuation report of this property and Roznamcha Entry 634 ExPW10/A, moreover bank had sanctioned credit limit of Rs. 110 lacs but in the above referredRoznamcha lien mark for Rs.80 lacs only. Accused Hardeep Singh should have confirmed from theconcerned authority in this regard before disbursement of the loan. which again proves hissaid property. Sh. Shamsher Singh Ahlawat had already sold 4 bigha land to Sh. D N Verma andSingh Ahlawat dishonestly and fraudulently handed over/deposited the original sale deed datedalready sold 8 bigha and 16 biswa land to other persons and thereby helped Jeevan Khanna infurtherance of the criminal conspiracy in connivance with Hardeep Singh to cheat the bank andcaused wrongful pecuniary gain to accused Jeevan Khanna and wrongful loss to the bank. 201 At thetime of enhancement of loan facilities, accused Jeevan Khanna had created equitable mortgage ofpurchased by Jeevan Khana from Smt. Suneet Prabha Arora W/o Satpal Arora on 10.04.98 and thesaid plot was transferred in the name of Jeevan Khanna on 13.05.98. Further Jeevan Khannaapplied C C No.18/03 127/133 in Estate Office HUDA to grant necessary permission to sell the sameplot on 02.11.98. Estate Office HUDA granted necessary permission to Jeevan Khanna vide theirletter No. 4094 dated 03.11.98 and Jeevan Khanna sold the said plot to Sh. Sunil Kumar Gupta R/oof Shri Sunil Kumar Gupta on 31.12.98.202 From the above discussion it is proved that accused Jeevan Khanna was having dishonestintention to cause wrongful loss to the bank and wrongful gain to himself from the very beginningCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/52when he had deposited the forged and fabricated Roznamcha entry no. 634 with the bank along withthe title deed of the property of accused Shamsher Singh as collateral security, major part of whichwas already sold. Dishonest intention of accused Jeevan Khanna is also proved at the time ofenhancement of the sanction limit when he had furnished the additional collateral security ofKumar Gupta.203       Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of AP Vs. IBS Prasada Rao & C C  No.18/03                                                             128/133"(A) Evidence Act (1 of 1872), S.3 - Criminal P.C.

The State of Uttar Pradesh AIR 1963Supreme Court 666 ( V 50 C 103) has held as follows:"The accused consigned small quantities of goods but subsequently tampered with the railwayreceipts by showing that the consignments were were of large quantities. The accused then endorsedthe railway receipts in favour of one of the firms belonging to them. Those firms drew large sums ofmoney commensurate with the large quantities of goods specified in the forged receipts and on thesecurity of those receipts drew demand drafts or hundis in favour of various banks.Held on the facts and circumstances of the case that the accused by obtaining credits for largeamounts on the strength of C C No.18/03 129/133 hundis supported by forged railway receipts hadmade a wrongful gain and therefore was guilty under S. 420 I P C." 205 Hon'ble Supreme Court inTammineedi Bhaskara Rao & Ors. Vs. State of A P & Anr. 2007 CRL. L J 1204 has held as follows:"The definition of cheating contains two classes of acts which the person deceived may be induced todo. Firstly, he may be induced fraudulently or dishonestly to deliver any property to any person or toconsent that any person shall retain any property. The second class of acts is the doing or omittingto do anything which the person deceived would not do or omit to do if he/she were not so deceived.In the first class of acts, the inducement must be fraudulent or dishonest and in the second class ofacts, it must be intentional but not fraudulent or dishonest. "Deceiving" means causing to believewhat is false or misleading as to a matter of facts or leading into error. Whenever a personfraudulently represents as an existing fact, that which is not an existing fact, he commits deception.The person cheated must have been intentionally induced to do an act which he would not haveCbi vs 1 Hardeep Singh on 11 December, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/103653148/53done, but for the deception practiced on him. The intention at the time of the offence and theconsequence of the act for omission has to be considered. The damage which is caused by the act oromission must be direct, natural or a probable consequence of C C No.18/03 130/133 the inducedact. The person deceived must have acted under the influence of the deceit. It is necessary that harmshould be caused to the person deceived. In the present case, the allegations in the complaint, inrelation to "cheating" under sections 417, 418 and 420, IPC are that the accused had cheatedcomplainant with knowledge that they were using her money, influence and position in the USA fortheir gain, causing wrongful loss to the complainant in every aspect of her life. Accepting as true theallegations that the intention of the accused was that the main accused should use his marriage, withthe complainant to go to the USA and to make them part with their money to ask his studies, stay inthe USA and as dowry, in effect, the complainant and her parents were induced to do somethingwhich they would not have done had they not been so deceived. It cannot, therefore, be said that theingredient of "cheating" are not attracted, even prima facie ".206 In view of the above discussion, it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that accused JeevanKhanna was having dishonest intention to cheat the bank from the very beginning. There is no meritin the argument that it was only a civil dispute and no criminal case is made out.C C No.18/03 131/133 207 Now it is well settled legal prepositions that companies and corporatehouses can be convicted for the commission of offence of cheating as defined under section 415 IPCpunishable under section 420 IPC. Hon'ble Supreme Court in this regard in Iridium India TelecomLtd vs. Motorola Incorporated & Ors., AIR 2011 SUPREME COURT 20 has held as follows:attributed to Corporations on principle of 'alter ego' of company".208 From the above discussions in this judgment, prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubtthat accused Hardeep Singh.
