The assessee also relied on certain decisions of the courts before the Commissioner but theCommissioner, apart from discussing the facts of each case made the following general observations:"Before proceeding to discuss these issues in detail, I would first like to point out that in all the casescited by the assessee in his defence, the fact that the assessees had received payments only in lieu oftheir right to sue was the admitted fact.

If the conclusion of the assessing officer is erroneous and prejudicial to theinterest of revenue reversionary jurisdiction of the Commissioner can be brought into play".Therefore, the Commissioner observed that the assessment order passed under section 143(3) by theassessing officer was erroneous inasmuch as it was prejudicial to the interest of revenue. He,therefore, directed the assessing officer to treat the amount of Rs. 21,00,000 received by theassessee from M/s. MBPL as revenue receipt taxable as capital gain. He further observed that theamount of liquidated damages will be restricted to Rs. 50,000 as covenanted in the agreement.2.10 The Commissioner also pointed out that the assessee did not choose to bring about any caseagainst the trespassers.

In the affidavit filed before us the assessee has stated :"I further say that the said submissions made by me in the letter dated 29-9-1997 were thoroughlydiscussed with Shri Anil Goel, Dy. CIT, Sp. Rg. 33, Mumbai on 29-9-1997 when he was satisfiedabout the claim of Shri Dhruv that the receipt of Rs. 21 lakhs from M/s. Mahendra Builders Pvt. Ltd.is a capital receipt and not liable to tax as capital gains because M/s. Mahendra Builders Pvt. Ltd.had really not sold the flat to Shri Dhruv as it was not belonging to M/s. Mahendra Builders Pvt.Ltd. I further say that Shri Anil Goel, Dy. CIT, Sp. Rg. 33, Mumbai had made reference to therecords of the Appropriate Authority which is having its office on 3rd Floor of Mittal Court, 13-Wing,Nariman Point, Mumbai-400 021.

CIT, Sp. Rg. 33, Mumbai and the said letter dated 29-9-1997 givingfull explanation about the receipt of Rs. 21 lakhs was found on the record of the Dy. CIT, Sp.

Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/14counsel of the assessee is that the letter dated 29-9-1997 was filed during the course of assessmentproceedings and was available on records of the assessing officer even during the course ofproceedings under section 263 before the Commissioner. The learned counsel, therefore, stated thatthe letter dated 29-9-1997 being not surprisingly found on record in the file produced by the learnedDepartmental Representative before the Tribunal, it is very much possible that the same may beavailable in some other folder and full production of records by the learned DepartmentalRepresentative will prove the assessee's contention. Thus, according to the learned counsel, theassessing officer had applied his mind to the full facts of the case in the course of assessmentproceedings before exempting the receipt of Rs. 21 lakhs from being taxed in the hands of theassessee and hence, as held by Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Gabriel India Ltd. (supra),the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to pass an order under section 263.2.14 Joining the issue with the learned Departmental Representative, the learned counsel contendedthat in para 6.2 of his order, the learned Commissioner has held that liquidated damages will berestricted to the covenanted amount in the agreement (i.e., Rs. 50,000) and the remaining amountwill be taxed as capital gains. According to the learned counsel, both these things cannot gotogether. It is argued by him that if the amount received by the assessee is treated as liquidateddamages, part of the same cannot be taxed as capital gain. The learned counsel pointed out thatwhile giving effect to the Commissioner's order, the assessing officer has excluded the amount of Rs.50,000 from capital gains. The learned counsel stated that M/s. MBPL had agreed to sell theunencumbered flat but the subsequent events showed that the flat was encumbered. Referring topage 32 of the Paper Book, the learned counsel contended that letter dated 25-5-1995, written by theassessee to M/s. MBPL, was not a termination agreement as there have to be two parties to anagreement. The learned counsel argued that the amount received was in fact a compensation for theright to sue. The learned counsel further argued that when the right in the said flat was not createdin favour of the assessee, there was no question of relinquishment of the same. The learned counseltook us through the definition of 'capital asset' given in section 2(14) of the Income Tax Act andstated that the assessee having been thrown out from the flat, there was no property held by theassessee and hence there was no question of its transfer. It was further stated that as the propertyhad already been sold by M/s. TPPL to Smt. Sarala Surya Narain and Shri Ajay Kumar SuryaNarain, even legally the assessee was not the owner. It was stated that in section 2(47) the 'transfer'is in relation to a capital asset. It was stated that when the capital asset is not there, there is noquestion of transferring the same. The learned counsel further stated that the decisions of Keralaand Bombay High Courts, relied on by the learned Departmental Representative, are distinguishablein facts.

That would not vestthe Commissioner with power to re-examine the accounts and determine the income himself at ahigher figure. It is because the Income Tax Officer has exercised the quasi-judicial power vested inhim in accordance with law and arrived at a conclusion and such a conclusion cannot be termed aserroneous simply because the Commissioner does not feel satisfied with the conclusion. It may besaid in such a case that in the opinion of the Commissioner the order in question is prejudicial to theinterests of the revenue."The learned counsel further pointed out that the decision of the assessing officer not to tax theliquidated damages of Rs. 21 lakhs was supported by four decisions of various High Courts whichwere quoted by the assessee in his written submissions dated 29-9-1997 filed before the assessingofficer.3. We have given a careful consideration to the rival submissions in the light of the materialpresented before us. We have also considered the various decisions relied on by both the sides. Weare of the opinion that the receipt of the liquidated damages of Rs. 21 lakhs by the assessee does notbear the character of income as it had no connection with the purchase of flat or with the transfer offlat but the amount appears to have been paid to the assessee as he was a victim of cheating on thepart of M/s.

The previouspurchasers of the flat had also made part payment to M/s. TPPL towards the purchase of the flat asper receipts available in the Paper Book. Shri Mahindra V. Shah was the common Director of thefirm M/s. TPPL and M/s. MBPL and the transfer of the flat by M/s. TPPL to M/s. MBPL was afraudulent transfer as the flat had already been sold by M/s. TPPL to Smt.

MBPL had no right ortitle in the said flat and hence there was no question of conveying that right and title to the assesseeby agreement dated 27-12-1992. This agreement was fraudulently entered into by M/s. MBPL withthe assessee -and hence we are of the opinion that it was not a valid agreement in the eyes of law.We, therefore, hold that agreement dated 27-12-1992 to sell the flat by M/s. MBPL to the assesseewas illegal. The flat having been sold by the original owner M/s. TPPL to Smt. Sarala Devi SuryaNarain and Shri Ajay Kumar Surya Narain, M/s. MBPL had no title to the flat and hence the samecould not be conveyed to the assessee by virtue of an agreement dated 27-12-1992. Thus, theassessee having no right in the said flat, there was no question of extinguishment of any righttherein. Thus, we hold that by virtue of settlement arrived at by exchange of letters dated 25-5-1995between the assessee and M/s. MBPL, there was no extinguishment of any right though as ameasure of abundant caution the assessee had stated in the letter dated 25-5-1995, written to M/s.MBPL, that he would not claim any right, title, interest or possession in respect of flat No. 101. Thus,we hold that there was neither a capital asset within the meaning of section 2(14) nor there was anytransfer within the meaning of section 2(47). The liability of the assessee to capital gains could ariseonly if there was a transfer of capital asset within the meaning of section 2(47). We, therefore, holdthat the amount of Rs. 21 lakhs received by the assessee as liquidated damages could not be treatedas capital gain. Since the assessee did not have to part with any stock-in-trade, the said receipt couldnot be treated even as a revenue receipt. Moreover, in the light of the decision of Hon'ble CalcuttaHigh Court in the case of Ashoka Marketing Ltd. (supra), we hold that since there was no element ofcost involved in the acquisition of Rs. 21 lakhs liquidated damages received by the assessee, theamount could not be treated either as capital gain or as a revenue receipt. The assessee had onlyfiled Police complaints and had not moved the courts. Subsequently, the settlement was arrived atand this right to sue for damages was extinguished by the settlement. In view of the decision ofHon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Bharat Forge Co. Ltd. (supra), we hold that right to suefor damage cannot be considered as a transfer of capital asset at all since the mere right to sue is nota property which could be transferred. Even the Hon'ble jurisdictional High Court has held in thecase of Abbasbhoy A. Dehagamwalal (supra) that right to sue is not a capital asset. Moreover., wefind that the learned Commissioner has not considered the decision of Bombay High Court inGabriel India Ltd.'s case in the right perspective. The further observations, which have beenreproduced by us above of Bombay High Court in this case tend to help the case of the assesseewhereas the learned Commissioner has only quoted the earlier observations of the court.

We have given a careful consideration to the rival submissions in the light of the materialpresented before us. We have also considered the various decisions relied on by both the sides. Weare of the opinion that the receipt of the liquidated damages of Rs. 21 lakhs by the assessee does notbear the character of income as it had no connection with the purchase of flat or with the transfer offlat but the amount appears to have been paid to the assessee as he was a victim of cheating on thepart of M/s.

Upon careful consideration of the matter I could not persuade myself to agree with thefindings of facts and the conclusion reached by my learned Brother, for the reasons given below :1. The assessment in the present case was framed vide order dated 13-10-1997 under section 143(3)of the Income Tax Act, 1961.2. During the assessment year 1992-93 the assessee had entered into an agreement for purchase offlat for a sum of Rs. 37,50,000 with M/s. Mahendra Builders Private Limited (M/s. MBPL). Thepossession of the said flat was given to the assessee by said M/s. MBPL in pursuance of the saidagreement. The possession of the said flat was forceably taken back from assessee by Smt. Sarla DeviSuraj Narain Kanav and Shri Ajay Kumar Suraj Narain Kanav (hereinafter referred to as 'thirdparty'). Though the assessing officer had mentioned in the assessment order that the assessee had torelinquish his interests in the said flat, however, the assessment order is silent about the totalamount received by the assessee in respect of flat which was Rs. 57,65,000. The facts of the case canbe summarised as follows :(i) Flat in question is known as Flat No. 101, in building No. 3 of 'Shirin Apartments' at TardeoRoad, (for the sake of convenience this flat hereinafter is referred to as 'flat');(h) The flat originally was owned by M/s. Tardeo property Private Limited (hereinafter referred toas M/s. TPPL);(iii) As per agreement to sell dated 6th May, 1981 the flat was agreed to be sold by M/s. TPPL to'third party' for total consideration of Rs. 2,09,050 to be payable in various instalments. Theevidence regarding payment of certain instalments had been furnished by the assessee in the paperbooks);(iv) On 10th April, 1986 M/s. TPPL entered into an agreement to sell the said flat to M/s. MBPL fora consideration of Rs. 9,45,000. Consequent to this agreement share Nos. 166 to 170 pertaining toflat in 'Shirin Co-operative Housing Society Ltd.' were transferred in the name of M/s. MBPL;(v) M/s. MBPL vide sale agreement dated 27-12-1992 agreed to sell the said flat to Shri D. N. Shahand his father (hereinafter called as assessee) for a consideration of Rs. 37,50,000. Out of this a sumof Rs. 36,65,000 was paid at the time of execution of the agreement thereby requiring M/s. MBPL tohandover to assessee five above mentioned original shares having distinctive Nos. 166 to 170.(vi) Out of the balance sum of Rs. 85,000, Rs. 50,000 was stipulated to be paid by the assessee toM/s. MBPL within a period of one week of granting of NOC (No Objection Certificate) by theappropriate authority under the provisions of section 269UD of the Act. The balance sum of Rs.35,000 was stipulated to be paid by the assessee to the society being half share of the transfer feepayable on receiving.

Thus, the assessee informed the incidence of 7-1-1993 to Mahindra Builders. M/s.MBPL told the assessee that on account of default of third party the agreement with third party wascancelled and a suit has been filed recently in the High Court for cancellation of agreement withthird party. Reference in this regard is made from the letter written by the assessee to JointCommissioner of Police dated 25-4-1995 (page 25 of paper book).(x) The assessee was promised by M/s. MBPL for the restoration of possession by settling the issuewith 'third party'. It was also promised by M/s. MBPL to return the money with interest thereonwithin a month if 'third party' is unable to restore the possession to the assessee. As the possessioncould not be restored a refund of Rs. 5 lakhs was given by M/s. MBPL to the assessee in April 1993.(Reference in this regard is made to the letter written by assessee to Joint Commissioner of Policedated 25-4-1995). It has been mentioned in the abovementioned letter addressed to Police as follows:"The builders made various promises in front of officer-in-charge to return the amount with interestthereupon but have not fulfilled. The total amount due in the last week of February, 1995 was settledat Rs. 50,00,000 (Rupees fifty lakhs only)."Ultimately on 25-5-1995 a sum of Rs. 52,65,000 was paid by M/s.

The assessing officer after carefulconsideration of the facts of the case, arrived at the conclusion that the relevant extra amount wasnot assessable to capital gain. The non-discussion in the assessment order by the assessing officer ofthis fact does not mean that the assessing officer did not apply his mind on the transaction. TheCommissioner, therefore, was not right in making revision on the ground that assessing officerfailed to consider the assessability of extra sum of Rs. 21 lakhs. For raising the proposition reliancehas been placed on the decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court in the case of Gabriel India Ltd.(supra).4.

Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/22assumption of facts or incorrect application of law is sufficient for invoking jurisdiction undersection 263 by Commissioner. Reference in this regard can be invited to the following observationsof Their Lordships of the Apex Court in the case of Malabar Industrial Co. Ltd. v. CIT (2000) 243ITR 831 (SC) that :"an incorrect assumptions of facts or an incorrect application of law will satisfy the requirement ofthe order being erroneous. Orders passed without applying the principles of natural justice orwithout application of mind, will also be orders which are erroneous". It has been further held that'the phrase "prejudicial to the interest of the revenue" is of wide import' and 'if due to an erroneousorder of the Income Tax Officer, the revenue is loosing tax lawfully payable by the assessee, suchorders will definitely be prejudicial to the interest of revenue".So, it has to be examined that whether there was incorrect assumption of facts or any incorrectapplication of law. For that purpose one has to go into the merits of the case. Apparently there is nodiscussion in the assessment order for non-assessability of the said sum of Rs. 21 lakhs. Therefore, ifa view is taken that the assessing officer had applied his mind on the assessability of the sum inquestion then we have to look into the submissions made by the assessee before assessing officer.According to said submission dated 29-9-1997 (page 38 of paper book), the sum of Rs. 21 lakhs wasreceived as liquidated damages. It is a compensation for mental tension and agony suffered by theassessee and his family members, loss of good bargain, steep rise in the price of real estate, loss dueto payment of taxes on capital gain earned. It was submitted that this sum in question did not bearthe character of income as it has no connection either with the purchase of flat or with the transferof flat. Reliance was placed on the following decisions:(i) Ashoka Mkt. Ltd.'s case (supra)(h) Hiralal Manilal Mody's case (supra)(iii) Baroda Cement & Chemicals Ltd. v. CIT(iv) Abbasbhoy A. Dehgamwalla's case (supra)(v) Bharat Forge Co. Ltd.'s case (supra).The facts of these cases have been discussed in detail in the order of Commissioner. Afterconsidering all these cases, the Commissioner has observed, in para 5.2 of his order, as under :"Before proceeding to discuss these issues in detail, I would first like to point out that in all the casescited by the assessee in his defence, the fact that the assessees' had received payments only in lieu oftheir right to sue was the admitted fact. Further, in all the cases there was no dispute as to the fact ofnon-performance of the agreement and breach of contract was established. In fact the cases revealthat in all the case specific performance was ruled out completely and all that the assessees' had wasa right to sue."Dhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/23As it could be seen from above conclusion of Commissioner that in the cases relied upon, the specificperformance of contract was ruled out completely and all that assessee had was a right to sue. Thusthe case laws relied upon by the assessee had no relevance on the facts of case. It has further beenpointed out by the Commissioner that assessee has been unable to prove that the case laws reliedupon by assessee are applicable to the facts and circumstances of the assessee's case because somequestions of paramount importance which would be vital in determining whether or not the amountof Rs. 21 lakhs is taxable, have gone unanswered. He set out these questions as below :(a) Whether or not the assessee received a good title?(b) Whether or not there was a breach of agreement ?(c) Whether the assessee was entitled to any damages and then whether he could have received anyamount beyond Rs. 50,000 as damages?It has further been mentioned by Commissioner in para 5.4.2:"The assessee did not even choose to bring about any case against the trespassers, the persons whohad caused him the severest damage. Nothing has been brought on record by the assessee to suggestthat the assessee had lodged any form of complaint before the competent authorities against thetrespassers who had forcibly evicted him from the premises. Instead the assessee lodged a report inthe police against the vendor to investigate the matter further."Simply on the basis that there existed a prior agreement of sale between 'third party' and M/s. TPPL,the assertion of assessee is that the agreement between assessee and M/s. MBPL was invalid one.This assertion of the assessee cannot be accepted at its face value unless examined by a competentcourt of law. It is clear from the facts that no steps were taken by the assessee to enforce the claim ofthe assessee in any court of law. There is a specific clause in the agreement executed betweenassessee and M/s. MBPL dated 27-12-1992 for meeting the consequences in case of wilful default ofany of the provision of the agreement. Clause 10 of the agreement reads as follows :"10. If the transferor commits wilful default of any of the provisions of the agreement thentransferees shall at their option be entitled to :(i) specific performance of the agreement for sale by the transferor and claim from the transferor thecost, charges, expenses and damages suffered by the transferees or in the alternative;(ii) rescind this agreement in which event the transferor shall be liable to forthwith refund to thetransferees the aggregate amount of Rs, 36,65,000 (Rupees thirty six lakh sixty five thousand) paidby the transferees to the transferor without interest together with the sum of Rs. 50,000 (Rupeesfifty thousand) as liquidated damages."Thus the assessee had a right to get specific performance. No reason has been advanced for notpressing this claim instead of the fact that almost all the consideration agreed upon had alreadyDhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/24passed, agreement was partly performed by handing over peaceful and vacant possession of theproperty in question. The original shares regarding flat were also handed over to the assessee.6. It is now well-settled by the various pronouncements of jurisdictional High Court that a right toobtain conveyance of immovable property is a "capital asset" within the meaning of section 2(14) ofthe Income Tax Act, 1961. These pronouncements have been extracted in the following paragraphsby the Hon'ble High Court in the case of Bafna Charitable Trust v. CIT .6. It is now well-settled by the various pronouncements of jurisdictional High Court that a right toobtain conveyance of immovable property is a "capital asset" within the meaning of section 2(14) ofthe Income Tax Act, 1961. These pronouncements have been extracted in the following paragraphsby the Hon'ble High Court in the case of Bafna Charitable Trust v. CIT ."11. In CIT v. Tata Services Ltd. , a question arose before this court whether a right to obtainconveyance of immovable property is capital asset within the meaning of section 2(14) of the Act.This court held :"A contract for sale of land is capable of specific performance. It is also assignable. Therefore, in ourview a right to obtain conveyance of immovable property is clearly property as contemplated bysection 2(14) of the Act."The above decision was followed by the court in CIT v. Sterling Investment Corpn. Ltd. , where itwas held that the contractual right of a purchase to obtain title to immovable property for a price,which is assignable, can be considered as a property and, therefore, a capital asset. In CIT v. VijayFlexible Containers , it was reiterated by this court that right to obtain conveyance of immovableproperty falls within the expression "property of any kind" used in section 2(14) of the Act and is,consequently a capital asset. It was held that the payment of earnest money in order to obtain such aright constitutes its cost of acquisition. Where such a right is given up, there is a transfer of capitalasset."7. As mentioned earlier the assessee did not advance any reason for not pressing his claim forspecific performance. On a close analysis of events and documents, the assessee was a bona fidepurchaser without notice of any existence of earlier agreement. The right to claim specificperformance was inherently available with the assessee, under these circumstances, non-pressing ofclaim suggests that such right was given up by the assessee which resulted in 'transfer of capitalasset'. It will be wrong to say that the amount of Rs. 21 lakhs received by the assessee was against amere right to sue. The right to sue was no doubt involved in it on breach of its stipulation, but beforebreach, there was also the right to have the land conveyed. A mere right to sue was applicable only tocases where there had been a breach resulting in damages and where the specific performance of thecontract could not be obtained. As mentioned earlier, the assessee was a transferee for considerationwithout notice, so he was entitled for having conveyance in his favour. I have also perused theagreement executed between 'third party' and M/s. TPPL. In the said agreement it has been timeand again stipulated that timely payments of the instalments is the essence of agreement. There wasDhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/25also some case filed in the High Court by the transferor for cancellation of the said agreement. Inthese circumstances, the assessee being bona fide purchaser without notice had a good case forspecific performance of agreement. There is no evidence on record to indicate that the assessee hasever pressed this right, instead he preferred to file criminal complaint against the vendor. Thesecircumstances suggest that the assessee had voluntarily surrendered his right to get specificperformance of the agreement by accepting the amount from the vendor. Giving up of the right toget specific performance was 'property of any kind' and thus a 'capital asset' under section 2(14) ofthe Act. The term 'property of any kind' has come up for consideration before the Bombay HighCourt in the case of Vijay Flexible Containers (supra), wherein Their Lordships observed as under :7. As mentioned earlier the assessee did not advance any reason for not pressing his claim forspecific performance. On a close analysis of events and documents, the assessee was a bona fidepurchaser without notice of any existence of earlier agreement. The right to claim specificperformance was inherently available with the assessee, under these circumstances, non-pressing ofclaim suggests that such right was given up by the assessee which resulted in 'transfer of capitalasset'. It will be wrong to say that the amount of Rs. 21 lakhs received by the assessee was against amere right to sue. The right to sue was no doubt involved in it on breach of its stipulation, but beforebreach, there was also the right to have the land conveyed. A mere right to sue was applicable only tocases where there had been a breach resulting in damages and where the specific performance of thecontract could not be obtained. As mentioned earlier, the assessee was a transferee for considerationwithout notice, so he was entitled for having conveyance in his favour. I have also perused theagreement executed between 'third party' and M/s. TPPL. In the said agreement it has been timeand again stipulated that timely payments of the instalments is the essence of agreement. There wasalso some case filed in the High Court by the transferor for cancellation of the said agreement. Inthese circumstances, the assessee being bona fide purchaser without notice had a good case forspecific performance of agreement. There is no evidence on record to indicate that the assessee hasever pressed this right, instead he preferred to file criminal complaint against the vendor. Thesecircumstances suggest that the assessee had voluntarily surrendered his right to get specificperformance of the agreement by accepting the amount from the vendor. Giving up of the right toget specific performance was 'property of any kind' and thus a 'capital asset' under section 2(14) ofthe Act. The term 'property of any kind' has come up for consideration before the Bombay HighCourt in the case of Vijay Flexible Containers (supra), wherein Their Lordships observed as under :"Having regard to the statutory provisions and the authorities which we have cited above, wecannot, with respect, agree that the right acquired under an agreement to purchase immovableproperty is a mere right to sue. The assessee acquired under the said agreement for sale, the right tohave the immovable property conveyed to him. He was, under the law, entitled to exercise that rightnot only against his vendors but also against a transferee with notice or a gratuitous transferee. 11ccould assign that right. What he acquired under the said agreement for sale was therefore, propertywithin the meaning of the Income Tax Act and, consequently, a capital asset. When he filed the suitin this court against the vendors, he claimed specific performance of the said agreement for sale byconveyance to him of the immovable property and, only in the alternative, damages for breach of theagreement. A settlement was arrived at when the suit reached hearing at which point of time theassessee gave up his right to claim specific performance and took only damages. His giving up of theDhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/26right to claim specific performance by conveyance to him of the immovable property was arelinquishment of a capital asset. There was, therefore, a transfer of a capital asset within themeaning of the Income Tax Act. We may, at this stage, also deal with the further argument thatthere was no consideration for the acquisition of the capital assets. In our view, this court was rightin the view that it took that the payment of earnest money under the agreement for sale was the costof acquisition of the capital asset."Moreover the transaction in question can also be considered to be falling under the expression"extinguishment of any right therein. Recently Apex Court in the case of CIT v. Mrs. Grace Collis(2001) 248 ITR 323 (SC) has observed "that the definition of 'transfer' clearly contemplates theextinguishment of right in a capital asset distinct and independent of such extinguishment.Consequent upon the transfer thereof. The expression "extinguishment of any rights therein" cannotbe limited to such extinguishment on account of transfers. The view that the expression"extinguishment, of any rights therein" cannot be extended to mean the extinguishment of rightsindependent of or otherwise than on account of transfer cannot be accepted".8. Much reliance has been placed by the assessee on the decision of Hon'ble Bombay High Court inthe case of Bharat Forge Co. Ltd. (supra). This decision is based on the decision of Hon'ble SupremeCourt in the case of Vania Silk Mills (P) Ltd. v. CIT . It is observed that the decision of SupremeCourt in Vania Silk Mills (P.) Ltd.'s case (supra) has been disapproved in the later decision ofSupreme Court in the case of Mrs. Grace Collis (supra). Moreover as pointed out earlier the case isalso distinguishable on facts.8.

The contention of the assessee that the sum of Rs. 21 lakhs was a liquidated damages is notacceptable for the following reasons. It is not in accordance with the agreement existed between theparties. Much stress has been given on the word 'forthwith' as existed in clause 10 of the agreement.It was argued that the amount of Rs. 50,000 was to be given only if the amount has to be refundedto the assessee immediately in case of non-performance of contract. It was not so done by thevendor. So the amount of Rs. 21 lakhs needs to be treated as liquidated damages given to assesseefor mental tension and agony suffered by the assessee and his family members, loss of good bargain,steep rise in the price of real estate, loss due to payment of taxes on capital gains earned.9.

The total amount due in the last week of February, 1995 was settledat Rs. 50,00,000 (Rupees Fifty lakhs only).11. Thus what represented the extra sum was interest on refundable amount.

The extra amount of Rs. 21 lakhs did not represent liquidated damages.The agreement between assessee and M/s. MBPL cannot be held to be invalid on the face of it. Itwas only on the strength of agreement, the assessee could receive the refund as well as extraamount. The assessee never asserted his right arising out of agreement in any court of law.

Ltd. However, some other personsforcibly took possession of the flat while the same was being furnished. After prolonged litigation,the assessee had to relinquish this interest in the said flat by way of cancellation of originalagreement. As a result, the entire capital gain of Rs, 33,23,358 has been offered by the assessee asshort term capital gain."Later on, the Commissioner of Income-tax, Mumbai City-VIII, Mumbai, while perusing the recordsof the assessee found that the assessee received Rs. 21 lakhs from M/s. MBPL, which the assessingofficer treated as capital receipt. The Commissioner was of the view that the impugned amountshould have been taxed as short term capital gain. Therefore, he was of the view that the amount ofRs. 21 lakhs received by the assessee from MBPL, is, in fact, a revenue receipt taxable as capital gain.Therefore, he directed the assessing officer to keep in mind the discussions made in Commissioner'sorder under section 263 and treat the amount as capital gain accrued and in lieu of relinquishmentof the rights vested in him in the property by virtue of agreement dated 27-12-1992 and fornon-receipt of peaceful possession of the flat on 27-12-1992. He further directed that the amount ofliquidated damages will be restricted to the covenanted amount in the agreement. He also directedthat the assessing officer shall give effect to his order after determining whether or not the asset is along term capital asset or not and then to give appropriate relief as may be admissible and issuenotice of demand in respect of the tax and interest arising therefrom.6.

The relevantportion of this letter reads as under :"A copy of the agreement dated 25-5-1995 between the assessee and M/s.

Accordingly, theassessee received the balance sum of Rs. 31,65,000 invested by them in purchase of the flat and alsoliquidated damage of Rs. 21,00,000 for the mental tension and agony suffered by the assessee andmembers of his family, loss of good bargain, steep rise in the real estate prices in the city of Bombayand loss due to payment of taxes on capital gains earned on the sale of the original flat."He pointed out that despite the proper putting up of the case before the assessing officer, there wasnot even a whisper in the assessment order about the liquidity damages received by the assesseefrom MBPL because he was certain that the receipt of Rs. 21 lakhs is a capital receipt not liable totax. He then pointed out that in his letter dated 2-11-2000, the assessee informed the AppropriateAuthority as under:"I had purchased Flat No. 101 in Shirin Apartment at 211/219, Tardeo Road, Mumbai-400 027 fromMahendra Builders Pvt.

Tardeo Properties Pvt. Ltd. They had filed copy of the said agreementwith the Appropriate Authority and reported certain facts."He pointed out that the assessee had given detailed explanation vide above two letters running into10 pages and 1 page respectively, which form part of the record. Evidently, the claim was allowed bythe assessing officer on being satisfied with the explanation of the assessee. Therefore, the decisionof the assessing officer cannot be held to be erroneous simply because the assessing officer did notmake elaborate discussion in respect of the said item of receipt. In this connection reliance wasplaced on the decision of Bombay High Court in the case of Gabriel India Ltd. (supra). He pointedout that section 263 does not visualise a case of substitution of the judgment of the Commissionerfor that of the assessing officer. Cases should be visualised where the assessing officer while makingthe assessment, examines the accounts, makes enquiries, applies his mind to the facts andcircumstances of the case and determines the income either by accepting the accounts or by makingsome estimate by himself. The Commissioner may be of the opinion that the estimate made by theassessing officer was on the lower side and left to the Commissioner, he would have estimated theincome at a higher figure than the one determined by the assessing officer. That would not vest theCommissioner with power to re-examine the accounts -and determine the income himself at ahigher figure. This is because the assessing officer has exercised the quasi-judicial power vested inhim in accordance with law and arrived at a conclusion and such a conclusion cannot be termed tobe erroneous simply because the Commissioner does not feel satisfied with the conclusion.Dhruv N.

He further relied on thedecision of Bombay High Court in the case of Abbasbhoy A Dehgamwalla (supra) and submittedthat the order of the assessing officer cannot be held to be erroneous. It is further submitted that theflat in question was already sold by M/s. TPPL to Smt. Sarladevi S Kanav & Others vide agreementdated 6-5-1981. But, the director, Shri Mahendra Shah, who was also director in MBPL, fraudulentlysold the flat to the assessee without having any right or title in the property, which was already soldto Smt. Sarladevi S. Kanav & Others. Therefore, the agreement dated 10-4-1986 between TPPL &MBPL was an invalid one and an unenforceable agreement. Thus, Shri Mahendrakumar Shah, alsothe director of MBPL had no right, title or interest in the said property which he could sell to theassessee, even though an agreement for sale dated 27-12-1992 was executed with the assessee, sincethe flat did not belong to MBPL. So by cheating the assessee he fraudulently made the assessee tobelieve that he was the owner of the flat and then illegally sold and accepted a sum of Rs. 36,65,000from the assessee as sale consideration of the flat. The amount was refunded only after the assesseefiled a criminal complaint under section 420 of the IPC vide FIR dated 10-12-1993 (page 50 of thepaper book). MBPL paid liquidity damages of Rs. 21 lakhs to the assessee because there was a steeprise in the real estate prices, mental tension and agony suffered by the assessee and his familymembers and for loss of good bargain. In other words, the liquidated damages were paid for thebreach of contract for selling the flat without having any right, title or interest attached to it. Thus,the right that the assessee has acquired on establishment of the breach of contract is a right to suefor damages which is not an actionable claim and, therefore, is not a capital asset.8.

The opinion of the learnedJudicial Member that the Commissioner has validly exercised the jurisdiction under section 263, isunfounded.

However, the Judicial Member haswrongly relied on the observation of the CIT given at paras 5.2, 5.4, etc. The Judicial Member hasalso wrongly interpreted the meaning of section 2(14) of the Income Tax Act, which defines the'capital asset' vis-a-vis the decision of Bombay High Court in the case of Bafna Charitable Trust(supra) and the decision of the Apex Court in the case of Mrs. Grace Collia (supra) as also thedecision of the Apex Court in the case of Vania Silk Mills (P) Ltd.

Now, the question arises whether the Commissioner can exercise jurisdiction under section 263in such a case where the assessee had offered a detailed explanation consequent upon the enquiriescast by the assessing officer and allowed the claim on being satisfied with the explanation of theassessee. In this regard, I find that in the case of Gabriel India Ltd. (supra), the Honourable BombayHigh Court has laid down the following principle :"The power of suo motu revision under sub-section (1) of section 263 of the Income Tax Act, 1961, isin the nature of supervisory jurisdiction and can be exercised only if the circumstances specifiedtherein exist. Two circumstances must exist to enable the Commissioner to exercise the power ofrevision under this sub-section, viz. (i) the order should be erroneous; and (ii) by virtue of the orderbeing erroneous prejudice must have been caused to the interests of the revenue. An order cannot betermed as erroneous unless it is not in accordance with law. If an Income Tax Officer acting inaccordance with law makes certain assessment, the same cannot be branded as erroneous by theCommissioner simply because, according to him, the order should have been written moreelaborately. This section does not visualize a case of substitution of the judgment of theCommissioner for that of the Income Tax Officer, who passed the order, unless the decision is heldto be erroneous. Cases may be visualized where the Income Tax Officer while making an assessmentexamines the accounts makes enquiries, applies his mind to the facts and circumstances of the caseand determines the income either by accepting the accounts or by making some estimates himself.The Commissioner, on perusal of the records, may be of the opinion that the estimate made by theofficer concerned was on the lower side and left to the Commissioner he would have estimated theincome at a higher figure than the one determined by the Income Tax Officer. That would not vestthe Commissioner with power to re-examine the accounts and determine the income himself at ahigher figure. This is because the Income Tax Officer has exercised the quasi-judicial power vestedin him in accordance with law and arrived at a conclusion and such a conclusion cannot be termedto be erroneous simply because the Commissioner does not feel satisfied with the conclusion. It maybe said in such a case that in the opinion of the Commissioner the order in question is prejudicial toDhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/41the interests of the revenue. But that by itself would not be enough to vest the Commissioner withthe power of suo motu revision because the first requirement, namely, that the order is erroneous, isabsent. Similarly if an order is erroneous but not prejudicial to the interests of the revenue, then thepower of suo motu revision cannot be exercised. Any and every erroneous order cannot be thesubject-matter of revision because the second requirement must be fulfilled. There must be someprima facie material on record to show that tax which was lawfully exigible has not been imposed orthat by the application of the relevant statute, on an incorrect or incomplete interpretation, a lessertax than what was just has been imposed. When exercise of statutory power is dependent upon theexistence of certain objective facts, the authority before exercising such power must have materialson record to satisfy it in that regard. If the action of the authority is challenged before the court itwould be open to the courts to examine whether the relevant objective factors were available fromthe records called for and examined by such authority.Held, that the Income Tax Officer in this case had made enquiries in regard to the nature of theexpenditure incurred by the assessee. The assessee had given a detailed explanation in that regardby a letter in writing. All these were part of the record of the case. Evidently, the claim was allowedby the Income Tax Officer on being satisfied with the explanation of the assessee. This decision ofthe Income Tax Officer could not be held to be "erroneous" simply because in his order he did notmake an elaborate discussion in that regard. Moreover, in the instant case, the Commissionerhimself, even after initiating proceedings for revision and hearing the assessee, could not say thatthe allowance of the claim of the assessee was erroneous and that the expenditure was not revenueexpenditure but an expenditure of capital nature. He simply asked the Income Tax Officer tore-examine the matter. That was not permissible. The Tribunal was justified in setting aside theorder passed by the Commissioner of Income Tax under section 263."While discussing various case laws and the meaning of the word "erroneous", the Hon'ble court hasobserved that from the definition it is clear that an order cannot be termed as erroneous unless it isnot in accordance with law. If an Income Tax Officer acting in accordance with law, makes a certainassessment, the same cannot be branded as "erroneous" by the Commissioner simply becauseaccording to him, the order should have been written more elaborately. This section does notvisualize a case of substitution of the judgment of Commissioner for that of an Income Tax Officer,who passed the order, unless, the decision is held to be "erroneous". Cases may be visualized, wherethe Income Tax Officer, while making an assessment, examines the accounts, makes enquiries,applies his mind to the facts and circumstances of the case and determines the income either byaccepting the accounts or by making some estimate himself. The Commissioner on perusal of therecord may be of the opinion that the estimate made by the officer concerned was lower and left tothe Commissioner, he would have estimated the income at a higher figure than the one determinedby the Income Tax Officer. That would not vest the Commissioner with the power to re-examine theaccounts and determine himself the income at a higher figure. Because the Income Tax Officer hasexercised the quasi judicial power vested in him in accordance with law and arrived at aconclusionand such a conclusion cannot be termed to be erroneous simply because the Commissioner does notfeel satisfied with the conclusion. It may be said, in such a case that in the opinion of theCommissioner the order in question is prejudicial to the interest of revenue. But that by itself willnot be enough to vest the Commissioner with the power of suo motu revision.Dhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/4217.

The confirmationswere filed, the statement of proprietor of payee was recorded, all these were part of the record.Evidently, the claim was allowed by the assessing officer on being satisfied with this explanation ofthe assessee. This decision of Income Tax Officer could not be held to be erroneous simply becausein his order, he did not make an elaborate discussion in that regard. Therefore, it is clear that wherethe assessee had given detailed explanation regarding his claim and the Assessing Officer passed anorder in which he did not make an elaborate discussion, does not give the Commissioner the powerto exercise revisionary jurisdiction under section 263.18.

The learned Judicial Member, while discussing the case on merit has opined that assessingofficer has based on incorrect assumption of facts or application of law, so the Commissioner hasrightly invoked the power, which, according to my mind is against the established principle laiddown by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court.19. The learned Judicial Member, while discussing the case on merit has opined that assessingofficer has based on incorrect assumption of facts or application of law, so the Commissioner hasrightly invoked the power, which, according to my mind is against the established principle laiddown by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court.20. In view of my discussion, I am of the view that the Commissioner (Appeals) has no power toexercise revisionary jurisdiction under section 263 in the given facts and circumstances of thepresent case. Therefore, I agree with the view expressed by the learned Accountant Member on thisissue.20. In view of my discussion, I am of the view that the Commissioner (Appeals) has no power toexercise revisionary jurisdiction under section 263 in the given facts and circumstances of thepresent case. Therefore, I agree with the view expressed by the learned Accountant Member on thisissue.21. The next issue for consideration is whether the amount received by the assessee from M/s.MBPL by way of liquidated damages is assessable to tax as capital gains. In this connection, I wouldlike to mention that the facts are not in dispute with the flat No. 101, situated at First Floor inbuilding No. 3 of Shirin Apartments, 211/219, Tardeo Road, Mumbai-7 originally belonged to TPPL.TPPL sold the above flat to Smt. Sarladevi Kavan & Ajay S. Kanav vide an agreement to sell dated6-5-1981. In pursuance to the said agreement, these purchasers of the flat also made a part paymentto M/s. TPPL towards the purchase of the flat as per receipt available in the paper book pages 86 &87. From the notice issued by the income-tax authorities under section 131 dated 17-2-1983 (paperbook page 88), it is clear that the Income-tax authorities made enquiries from 'the said purchasersabout the source of purchase of that flat which is also clear from the specific query raised by thedepartment given overleaf of the notice (page 89). So it is clear that the transaction of selling theproperty to Smt. Sarladevi Kanav & Ajaykumar Kanav was a real transaction between the TPPL andthe purchasing parties. It is noteworthy that Shri Mahendrakumar Shah was common director of thefirm TPPL and MBPL. It seems that when a dispute has arisen between Sarladevi Kanav &Ajaykumar Kanav and TPPL, Shri Mahendrakumar Shah being the common director of both thefirms has fraudulently transferred the flat in the name of MBPL and subsequently entered into anagreement between MBPL and the assessee vide agreement dated 10-4-1986. Consequent to thefraudulent agreement between TPPL, and MBPL Shri Mahendrakumar Shah got the share certificateNos. 166 to 170 pertaining to the above flat in Shirin Co-operative Housing Society transferred in thename of M/s. MBPL when the agreement between TPPL and Smt. Sarladevi Kanav & others was stillvalid. While lodging a complaint, the assessee in his application to the Joint Commissioner of Policedated 25-4-1995 has informed that Mahendrakumar Shah told him that the earlier agreement hasDhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/44been cancelled and suit has been filed in the High Court for cancellation of the agreement withSarladevi Kanav & others. These facts have not been denied by the revenue authorities and there isno material on record to show that the earlier agreement with Sarladevi Kanav & others wascancelled before an agreement was entered into by Mr. Mahendrakumar Shah as director of MBPLwith the assessee. Therefore, on these facts it is clear that M/s. MBPL had no right or title or interestin the impugned flat. Hence, the question of conveying the right, title or interest in the said flat tothe assessee by an agreement dated 27-12-1992 does not arise. This agreement in the given facts andcircumstances can be conveniently be held as fraudulent transaction by MBPL with the assessee.Therefore, in the eyes of law, it is not a valid agreement, since the flat has already been sold by theoriginal owner, M/s. TPPL, to Smt. Sarladevi Kanav & Others. That is how on the basis of the earlieragreement even after this fraudulent transaction with the assessee, they, before getting the 'NoObjection Certificate', occupied the flat on 7-1-1993. On these facts the seller MBPL though had noright, title and interest in the flat purported to be transferred to the assessee by virtue of anagreement. That is why, Shri Mahendrakumar Shah, made settlement out of the court after thematter was reported to the Crime Branch of the Police and returned the amount paid by the assesseeand also paid a sum of Rs. 21 lakhs as liquidated damages. So, according to me, there is noextinguishment of any right therein, though as a measure of abundant precaution, the assessee hasstated in the letter dated 25-5-1995 that he could not claim any right, title, interest or possession inthe above flat when a settlement was reached out of court. Therefore, I hold that there was neither acapital asset within the meaning of section 2(14) nor there was any transfer of the said capital assetunder section 2(47). The question of capital gain arises only when there is a transfer of capital assetwithin the meaning of these two sections.21.

MBPL purported to transfer the capital asset without having any right, title orinterest in it. Therefore, the assessee did not get any right, title or interest in the capital asset. Whathe got is the mere right to sue. The same right to sue for damages is not an actionable claim. Theright to sue for damages for breach of contract, no doubt, is capable of maturing into a right toreceive damages for breach of contract. But that happens only when the damages claimed for breachof contract are either admitted or decreed and not before. In the case of Abbasbhoy A. Dehgamwalla(supra), the Hon'ble Bombay High Court has held that the right to sue could not be termed as capitalasset if an amount is received as consideration.

Transfer of such a right is as such opposed to public policyDhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/46as is gambling in litigation. As such, it will not be quite correct to say that such a right constituted a"capital gain" which in turn has to be "an interest in property of any kind". The action of theassessee's right under the agreement of 1945 being conveyed or substituted by another right whichcan be said to be a "capital asset" does not, therefore, arise. .. "". . . In our judgment, the only reasonable conclusion is that the right to receive damages in this caseaccrued to the assessee on the date of the consent decree only. Since, as already stated by us, theright under the agreement came to an end in the year 1961, if not earlier, and the right acquired inlieu thereof was only a mere right to sue, it cannot be accepted that the amount of Rs. 2,52,000 wasreceived as consideration for the transfer of a "capital asset" ...."23. In the case of Bharat Forge Co. Ltd. (supra), the Hon'ble Bombay High Court has observed thatthe phrase "extinguishment of right" takes colour from the associated words and expressions andwill have to be restricted to the sense analogous to them. Hence, the expression "extinguishment ofany rights therein" will have to be confined to the extinguishment of rights on account of transferand cannot be extended to mean any extinguishment of right independent of or otherwise than onaccount of transfer. It was further observed that right to sue for damages could not be considered asa capital asset at all since a mere right to sue is not a property which can be said to be "transfer".Applying the said principle laid down by the Hon'ble High Court, I find that there is noextinguishment of right. Rather, what the assessee has obtained was right to sue only. Therefore,this cannot be held to be a capital asset.23. In the case of Bharat Forge Co. Ltd.

In the present case, an issue was raised by the department that the assessee had a right ofspecific performance as per the agreement. Therefore, the liquidated damages received relates to thecapital asset. I have already mentioned that when MBPL made a fraudulent transaction withouthaving right, title or interest in the property, the question of right for specific performance for thecontract does not arise because suit for specific performance of contract could only be decreedagainst the executant of the contract provided the executant had right to dispose of the propertyabout which the suit is filed. This view was expressed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case ofSmt. Annapoorani Ammal (supra). Therefore, the argument of the learned departmentalrepresentative has no force.Dhruv N. Shah vs Dy.

Therefore, in the given facts and circumstances of the present case, I am of the opinion that theliquidated damages received by the assessee, cannot be brought to capital gain tax. It is not anincome in the nature of capital receipt which was rightly not taxed by the assessing officer. I,therefore, agree with the view taken by the learned Accountant Member.26.

It is not anincome in the nature of capital receipt which was rightly not taxed by the assessing officer. I,therefore, agree with the view taken by the learned Accountant Member.27. Further, all receipts are not taxable under the Income Tax Act. Section 2(24) defines "income". Itis no doubt that this is an inclusive definition. However, a capital receipt is not income under section2(14) unless it is chargeable to tax as capital gain under section 45. It is for that reason that undersection 2(24)(vi), the Legislature has expressly stated inter alia, that income shall include capitalgain chargeable under section 45. Under section 2(24)(vi), the Legislature has not included allcapital gains as income. It is only capital gain chargeable under section 45 which has been treated asincome under section 2(24). Further under section 2(24)(vi), the Legislature has not stopped withthe words "any capital gains". On the contrary it is obviously stated that only capital gains which areDhruv N. Shah vs Dy. Cit on 30 May, 2003Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/889110/48taxable under section 45 could be treated as "income". In other words, capital gains not chargeableto tax under section 45 fall outside the definition of "income" in section 2(24). Therefore, the words"chargeable under section 45" are very important. So, whenever an amount which is otherwise acapital receipt is to be charged under section 2(24), and when specifically so provides for notcharging to capital gain for any reason under section 45, the same cannot be brought to tax asincome by applying the general connotation under section 2(24). It is for this reason that proviso(i)(x) (sic.) to section 3 also refers to capital gain chargeable under section 45. The said provisionuses the same phraseology as is used in section 2(24)(vi). In other words, capital gain chargeableunder section 45 alone constitutes income. Further, such capital gains are required to be computedunder the scheme of sections 45 to 55. It is for this reason that such capital gain did not fall undersection 10(3) also. In other words, when the source of receipt has a link with business income orsalary income or capital gains chargeable under section 45, then section 10(3) will not apply.Therefore, if any amount of capital gain is not taxable as capital gain for any reason, then thatamount cannot be treated as a casual and non-recurring receipt under section 10(3) of the Act also.27.
