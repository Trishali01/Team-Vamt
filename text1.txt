The offence alleged against them is under section 364(A) r/w 34 of IPC.Petitioners have been in custody from 20.07.2012.2. The learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the defacto complainant had actuallyexecuted the document with her full consent. This submission is strongly resisted by the learnedPublic Prosecutor. It is alleged that on 17.07.2012 at about 9.00 PM, the accused persons kidnappedthe son of the defacto complainant and compelled the complainant to execute a document in favourof and as desired by the accused. It is further submitted by the the learned Public Prosecutor thatthe accused are members of a "quotation gang" and they are involved in so B.A.No.5929/2012 manyother crimes.3. The prosecution contends that the accused abducted the son of the complainant in order tocompel the complainant to execute the documents and as such section 364(A) may apply. Theinvestigation is only at the initial stage. The Investigating Officer has collected sufficient material toshow the complicity of the accused persons, the learned Public Prosecutor submits. It is also statedthat these petitioners and other accused persons had entered into a criminal conspiracy for thecommission of the offence.Since the investigation is only at the initial stage and as the release of the accused at this stage wouldhamper the smooth investigation, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioners at this stage.Hence it is dismissed.Sd/-N.K.BALAKRISHNAN, JUDGE.Aji Bright vs UnknownIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165339935/2ds //True copy// P.A. to JudgeAji Bright vs UnknownIndian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/165339935/3
