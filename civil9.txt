This group of appeals raises an important question with regard to the status of the law officersengaged by the State Government to conduct the cases on its behalf in the High Court. Incidentally,questions bearing on the profession of the lawyer, his relationship with his client, and therelationship of the Government and for that matter of all the public bodies with the lawyers theyengage for conducting their matters, also fall for consideration.3. At the relevant time, there were 64 law officers working for the U.P. State Government in theHigh Court of Allahabad including its Lucknow Bench. By an order dated July 23, 1990, the StateGovernment removed 26 of the said law officers. Out of these, 9 law officers had been working for aState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/1long time, some of them for more than 15 years. Their continuation as law officers was till furtherorders. Another 11 officers out of the removed officers had been appointed in 1982-83 and theycontinued to work till the date of their removal without renewal of their term. The remaining six lawofficers were appointed variously in March and May 1989 for a period of one year only with astipulation that they could be removed any time without giving any reason whatsoever. Their termhad also not been renewed after the expiry of the initial period of their appointment. There is nodispute that in cases of all these 26 officers and indeed in cases of all the law officers appointed inthe High Court, the terms of appointment contained a condition that notwithstanding the period forwhich they were appointed, they could be removed at any time without giving any reasonwhatsoever.4. It appears that before issuance of the aforesaid order of removal dated July 23, 1990, the StateGovernment had issued another order on May 26, 1990 by which the system of engaging BriefHolders in the High Court was abolished with immediate effect. By yet another order of June 28,1990, the Government had authorised the Legal Remembrancer to appoint special counsel for anyspecial matter before the High Court. The order also gave him financial and administrative powerswhich were earlier exercised by the Chief Standing Counsel and the Public Prosecutor. He wasfurther given power to distribute the work to the various Standing Counsel and the Additional PublicProsecutors.5. Aggrieved by the order dated July 23, 1990, the law officers who were removed from their posts,and aggrieved by the order of May 26, 1990, the then Brief Holders approached the High Court by awrit petition contending, among other things, that their removal was against the principles ofnatural justice and that they could be removed from their offices only for valid reasons. The HighCourt accepted the contention of the law officers and by its impugned judgment, quashed the ordersremoving them from their offices. The High Court also quashed the order dated May 26, 1990passed by the State Government by which the Government had abolished the system of theengagement of Brief Holders and directed the respondents to continue the said system. The HighCourt further quashed all the fresh appointments made by the State Government and directed thepayment of remuneration to the officers who were removed, from the date of their removal. In thecourse of the judgment, the High Court has also made observations against the LegalRemembrancer. These appeals are, therefore, preferred by the State as well as those who were newlyappointed by the State Government as its law officers.6. Before we refer to the contentions advanced on both sides, it would be worthwhile to explain thesystem which was prevalent in the State for engaging lawyers to attend to the government work inthe High Court and also the role assigned to the Legal Remembrancer vis-a-vis the governmentlawyers. Chapter V of the Legal Remembrancer's Manual (hereinafter referred to as the 'Manual')deals with the Chief Standing Counsel and the Standing Counsel in the High Court and Chapter VIof the said Manual deals with Brief Holders in the High Court. Chapter VII deals with DistrictGovernment Counsel with whom we are not concerned in the present appeals. However, thatchapter has a bearing on the contentions advanced before us and we will deal with the same whilediscussing the contentions. Suffice it for the present to bear in mind that the appointment andconditions of engagement of District Government Counsel have been dealt with in the said ManualState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/2separately from the appointment of the Chief Standing Counsel, Standing Counsel and Brief Holdersin the High Court.7. Paragraph 5.01 of Chapter V states that there shall be one Chief Standing Counsel for the HighCourt at Allahabad and another for its Lucknow Bench and such number of Standing Counsel atboth the said benches as the State Government may from time to time appoint. Paragraph 5.02states that in making the appointments of the Chief Standing Counsel as well as the StandingCounsel, the State Government "may, if considered necessary" take into consideration the views ofthe Advocate-General or the Chief Justice or any Judges of the High Court or of any committee that"may be" constituted for the purpose. Paragraph 5.03 then refers to the responsibility of the ChiefStanding Counsel for conducting the cases. It states that he shall be responsible for the conduct ofall civil cases in the High Court to which the State Government is a party except such cases or classof cases as are excluded by the State Government by general or special order. It further states thatthe Chief Standing Counsel shall work subject to such general or special directions as may be issuedby the Advocate-General or the Legal Remembrancer from time to time. Sub-paragraph (2) of thesaid paragraph states that the Government may entrust any case of special importance to theAdvocate-General or to a special counsel. Paragraph 5.04 refers to the duties of the Chief StandingCounsel. These duties include (i) representation of the State or of any authority within the State insuch other civil cases in which he might be directed or required to appear by the Government, theLegal Remembrancer or the High Court; (ii) to present to the High Court under instructions fromthe Legal Remembrancer, appeals, or applications or petitions on behalf of the State; (iii) to advisethe Government or the Legal Remembrancer when so required in any matter of a civil nature; (iv) tomake suitable arrangements for the conduct of civil cases in the High Court in accordance with anygeneral or special order of the Government or the Legal Remembrancer; (v) to assign cases to theStanding Counsel and then to the Brief Holders appointed by the Government;(vi) to report to the Legal Remembrancer the cases in which the State Counsel had been adverselycommented upon by the High Court; (vii) to procure and submit to the Legal Remembrancer copiesof any judgment or order of the High Court that the Government may require or where immediatesteps by the State Government are necessary; (viii) to ask for instructions from the LegalRemembrancer in regard to the contest of the matters on behalf of the State Government; (ix) toreport to the Legal Remembrancer the receipt of any process on behalf of the Government and tofurnish him with a copy of the memo of appeal, revision or application as the case may be; (x) tosend his opinion to the Legal Remembrancer as to whether any case is fit for further appeal to theSupreme Court and to submit to the Legal Remembrancer such returns as the latter may from timeto time prescribe or require.8. Paragraph 5.05 refers to the duties of Standing Counsel and states that the Standing Counsel shallgenerally assist the Chief Standing Counsel in performing his duties and functions and shall performsuch functions and conduct such cases as may be allotted to them by the Chief Standing Counsel orby any general or special order of the Government. Paragraph 5.07 places restriction on privatepractice of both the Chief Standing Counsel and Standing Counsel. It states that they shall not, savewith the special permission, appear against the State in any civil case or proceeding nor shall theyadvise any private party regarding any civil case which might be pending or is likely to be institutedState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/3against the State or any State authority. It also states that they shall not, without the permission ofthe Legal Remembrancer communicate directly or indirectly to any person or authority the contentsof any documents or convey any information which has come to their possession or knowledge inthe course of their duties in any case in which they appear on behalf of the State Government. Theyshall also not accept any appointment as Director of any company without the previous sanction ofthe Government. Paragraph 5.08.requires the Chief Standing Counsel to arrange and regulate workin such a manner that an adequate number of Standing Counsel and/or Brief Holders are present inthe High Court on every day on which cases under his charge are fixed for hearing. Paragraph 5.10gives power to the State Government to transfer the Chief Standing Counsel or any StandingCounsel from Allahabad to Lucknow and vice versa in consultation with the Advocate-General forsuch period and on such terms as may be determined by the Government. They may also be askedby the Legal Remembrancer to appear on behalf of the State Government in any civil case in anyCourt in the State in or outside Allahabad or Lucknow. Paragraph 5.16 requires that except whenotherwise expressly provided, all communications between the Government and the Chief StandingCounsel and the Standing Counsel shall be made through the Legal Remembrancer except in casesof urgency. But even in such cases, the copy of the communications shall invariably be sent to theLegal Remembrancer. It is not necessary to refer to the other provisions of this chapter.9. Paragraph 6.02 of Chapter VI which deals with the Brief Holders in the High Court refers to theappointment of a panel of Brief Holders in the High Court. It states that the State Government mayin consultation with the Advocate- General appoint such number of Brief Holders from amongst thepractising advocates in the High Court as it may deem necessary from time to time to conduct suchcivil and criminal cases in the High Court as may be entrusted to them. The paragraph makes it clearthat such appointments " shall not be deemed to be appointment to any office or post but onlyprofessional engagement which shall be terminable on either side at will". It requires a minimum of5 years' practice at the bar for appointment as a Brief Holder. Paragraph 6.03 states that a BriefHolder shall ordinarily be appointed in the first instance for a period not exceeding one year andthat the subsequent appointments may be for such number of years not exceeding three as the StateGovernment may deem necessary from time to time. The remuneration of the Brief Holders isreferred to at Paragraph 6.04. On the civil side, the Brief Holder is entitled to the same fee as wouldbe payable to a Standing Counsel for doing similar work and on the criminal side, the remunerationis mentioned in terms of fee per day irrespective of the number of cases conducted and the hours ofwork put in by him. No salary or any other kind of monthly remuneration is payable to him. In caseof dispute with regard to the fee, the decision of the Legal Remembrancer is to be final. Paragraph6.05 states that it is the Government Advocate who shall allot criminal cases and the Chief StandingCounsel who shall allot civil cases to the Brief Holders and shall also exercise supervision andcontrol over them. Paragraph 6.06 then states that the Government Advocate and the ChiefStanding Counsel shall entrust only such cases to the Brief Holders which cannot be attended to bythem or other law officers under them and which are not required to be conducted personally bythem. It also details classes of cases which shall not, ordinarily, be entrusted to the Brief Holders.Paragraph 6.07 requires the entrustment of cases to the Brief Holders by rotation in a manner asmay ensure an equitable distribution of work among all of them except where the GovernmentAdvocate or the Chief Standing Counsel may in the interest of the better prosecution of cases think itnecessary to depart from the rule. Paragraph 6.1 1 gives the Brief Holder, the right to private practiceState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/4and also for accepting cases against the Government. Paragraph 6.13 refers to the manner ofremoval of Brief Holder and states that the Government may at any time without prior notice andwithout assigning any reason whatsoever, remove the name of the Brief Holder from its panel.Paragraph 6.16 prohibits Brief Holders from participating in any political activity so long as theywork as Brief Holders. The other provisions of the chapter are not relevant for our purpose.10. The conditions of service of the Government Advocate and Additional Government Advocate,Deputy Government Advocate or Assistant Government Advocate for conducting criminal mattersin the High Court are the same as that of the Chief Standing Counsel and the Standing Counselrespectively.11. Since the respondents have relied heavily on a judgment of this Court in Shrilekha Vidyarthi v.State of U. P. 1 which deals specifically with appointments and removal of the District GovernmentCounsel and the Additional/Assistant District Government Counsel, and the appellants have tried todistinguish the said judgment, it is necessary to examine the relevant conditions of service of theDistrict Government Counsel as detailed in Chapter VII of the said Manual. The DistrictGovernment Counsel are legal practitioners appointed by the State Government to conduct in anycourt other than the High Court such civil, criminal or revenue cases on behalf of the StateGovernment as may be assigned to them either generally or specially (paragraph 7.01). TheGovernment have also the power to appoint Additional or Assistant District Government Counsel orSubordinate District Government Counsel to assist the District Government Counsel (paragraph7.02). Paragraph 7.03 relates to the appointment of the District Government Counsel. Whenever thepost of any of the District Government Counsel is likely to fall vacant or when a new post has beencreated, the District Magistrate concerned has to notify the vacancy to the members of the Bar. Thequalification for appointment as a District Government Counsel, Assistant District GovernmentCounsel and Sub- District Government Counsel is 10 years', 7 years' and 5 years' practicerespectively. The District Magistrate shall also ask those who want to be considered for appointmentto give their names to him with their particulars such as age, length of practice at the Bar,proficiency in Hindi, income tax paid by him on professional income during the last three years,details of the work handled by them during the preceding two years duly verified by the court andalso to state whether they have practised on the criminal, civil or revenue side. The DistrictGovernment Counsel and the legal practitioners of the neighbouring districts are also eligible to beconsidered for the said post and they have to forward their particulars through their DistrictMagistrate who has to offer his own remarks on the particulars so given. When the names are soreceived, they have to be considered by the District Magistrate in consultation with the DistrictJudge. The District Magistrate has to give due weight to the claim of the existing incumbents if any,and has to submit confidentially in the order of preference the names of the legal practitioners to theLegal Remembrancer. He has also to give his opinion, particularly, about the character, professionalconduct and integrity of the candidate and 1 (1991) 1 SCC 212: 1991 SCC (L&S) 742 forward to theLegal Remembrancer the opinion of the District Judge on the suitability and merits of eachcandidate. The District Magistrate has also to send to the Legal Remembrancer, the bio datasubmitted by other candidates with such comments that he and the District Judge may like to make.The District Magistrate is also required to recommend the name of any person who may beconsidered fit by him although he has not formally supplied his particulars. Paragraph 7.04 thenState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/5states that on receipt of the recommendations of the District Magistrate, the Legal Remembrancermay, if necessary, make such further inquiry about the candidate as he may deem necessary andthen submit the recommendations of the District Magistrate along with his own opinion for theorders of the Government whose decision shall be final. Paragraph 7.06 states that the legalpractitioners who are finally selected by the Government may be appointed as District GovernmentCounsel for one year. At the end of the period of one year, the District Magistrate after consultingthe District Judge has to submit a report on his work and conduct to the Legal Remembrancertogether with the statement of work done by him. If his work and conduct are found to beunsatisfactory, the matter has to be reported to the Government for orders. If the report on his workand conduct is satisfactory, the appointee may be furnished with a deed of engagement in Form No.1 annexed to the Manual and the engagement is to be for a term not exceeding three years. The saidparagraph makes it explicitly clear that the appointment of a legal practitioner as DistrictGovernment Counsel is only a professional engagement terminable at will on either side and is notan appointment to a post under the Government. Accordingly, the Government reserves the powerto terminate the appointment of any District Government Counsel at any time without assigning anyreason. Paragraph 7.07 bars the District Government Counsel from participating in politicalactivities. Paragraph 7.08 deals with the renewal of the term of the District Government Counseland states that at least three months before the expiry of the term, the District Magistrate shall afterconsulting the District Judge and considering the incumbent's past record of work and conduct andage, report to the Legal Remembrancer together with a statement of work done by him, whether inhis opinion, the term of appointment of such counsel should be renewed or not. The DistrictMagistrate has to send along with his own recommendations, the opinion of the District Judge.While giving his recommendations for renewal of the term, the District Judge has to give anestimate of the quality of the counsel's work from the judicial standpoint, his capacity as a lawyerand his professional conduct. Similarly, the District Magistrate while giving his report about thesuitability of the District Government Counsel from the administrative point of view, has to reporton the candidate's public reputation in general, his character, integrity and professional conduct. Ifthe Government agrees with the recommendations of the District Magistrate for the renewal of theterm of the Government Counsel, it may pass orders for reappointing him for a period not exceedingthree years. If the Government decides not to reappoint any Government Counsel, the LegalRemembrancer may call upon the District Magistrate to forward fresh recommendations. Thisprocedure is to be followed on the expiry of every successive period of renewed appointment. For theabove purpose, the District Magistrate and the District Judge are required to keep a character rolland maintain a record of the work done by the District Government Counsel and the capacitydisplayed by him in the discharge of his work. The Government (in Judicial Advice Section) is alsorequired to keep similar character roll based upon the copy of the confidential reports recorded bythe District Magistrate and the District Judge, and forward it to the Legal Remembrancer. Theshortcomings on the part of the District Government Counsel have at once to be brought to thenotice of the Legal Remembrancer. The District Government Counsel (Civil) is prohibited altogetherfrom advising or appearing against the State or Central Government in any civil case pertaining tothe district or the local area to which he is appointed. However, he may appear against the State orthe Central Government with the prior permission of the Legal Remembrancer in any civil case inwhich he has not been retained by the Government. Subject to this restriction, the DistrictGovernment Counsel (Civil) has a right to private practicesState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/612. The District Government Counsel (Civil) is prohibited from becoming a counsel of anyMunicipality or Municipal Corporation or other local authorities of the area to which he isappointed. The Assistant District Government Counsel (Civil) is prohibited from appearing in suitsinstituted by private parties against the State or Union of India in courts in which according to theallocation of work, he is alone authorised to represent the State. He is, however, free to take upprivate cases against the State or Union of India in other courts. Similar restriction is placed on theSub-District Government Counsel. As regards, the District Government Counsel (Criminal) andAdditional District Government Counsel (Criminal), they are prohibited from appearing for anyprivate party in any criminal case. However, with certain exceptions, with the prior approval of theLegal Remembrancer, they are allowed to appear. Similar restrictions are placed on DistrictGovernment Counsel (Revenue). Paragraph 7.18 states that the District Government Counsel in adistrict shall be subject to the supervision of the Legal Remembrancer as well as the DistrictMagistrate. Their confidential reports are also to be submitted by the District Magistrate to theGovernment through the Legal Remembrancer. Paragraphs 7.19 to 7.22 deal with the duties of theDistrict Government Counsel (Civil), (Criminal), (Revenue) respectively. Paragraphs 7.24 andparagraphs 7.26 to 7.45 deal with the fees payable to the District Government Counsel. Paragraph7.61 gives power to the Legal Remembrancer to forfeit the fees payable to the District GovernmentCounsel in certain cases. The conditions of service of the Additional/ Assistant /Subordinate DistrictGovernment Counsel are similar to those of the District Government Counsel mutatis mutandis.13. The appointment of lawyers by the Government and the public bodies to conduct work on theirbehalf, and their subsequent removal from such appointment have to be examined from threedifferent angles, viz., the nature of the legal profession, the interests of the public and the modes ofthe appointment and removal.14. Legal profession is essentially a service-oriented profession. The ancestor of today's lawyer wasno more than a spokesman who rendered his services to the needy members of the society byarticulating their case before' the authorities that be. The services were rendered without regard tothe remuneration received or to be received. With the growth of litigation, lawyering became afull-time occupation and most of the lawyers came to depend upon-it as the sole source oflivelihood. The nature of the service rendered by the lawyers was private till the Government and thepublic bodies started engaging them to conduct cases on their behalf. The Government and thepublic bodies engaged the services of the lawyers purely on a contractual basis either for a specifiedcase or for a specified or an unspecified period. Although the contract in some cases prohibited thelawyers from accepting private briefs, the nature of the contract did not alter from one ofprofessional engagement to that of employment. The lawyer of the Government or a public body wasnot its employee but was a professional practitioner engaged to do the specified work. This is soeven today, though the lawyers on the full-time rolls of the Government and the public bodies aredescribed as their law officers. It is precisely for this reason that in the case of such law officers, thesaving clause of Rule 49 of the Bar Council of India Rules waives the prohibition imposed by the saidrule against the acceptance by a lawyer of a full-time employment.15. The relationship between the lawyer and his client is one of trust and confidence. The clientengages a lawyer for personal reasons and is at liberty to leave him also, for the same reasons. He isState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/7under no obligation to give reasons for withdrawing his brief from his lawyer. The lawyer in turn isnot an agent of his client but his dignified, responsible spokesman. He is not bound to tell the courtevery fact or urge every proposition of law which his client wants him to do, however irrelevant itmay be. He is essentially an adviser to his client and is rightly called a counsel in some jurisdictions.Once acquainted with the facts of the case, it is the lawyer's discretion to choose the facts and thepoints of law which he would advance. Being a responsible officer of the court and an importantadjunct of the administration of justice, the lawyer also owes a duty to the court as well as to theopposite side. He has to be fair to ensure that justice is done. He demeans himself if he acts merelyas a mouthpiece of his client. This relationship between the lawyer and the private client is equallyvalid between him and the public bodies.16. Over the years, the public sector has grown considerably, and with its extension and expansion,the number of lawyers engaged in the public sector has increased noticeably so much so that it cantruly be said that today there is a public sector in the legal profession as well. The expansion of thepublic sector activities has necessitated the maintenance of a permanent panel of lawyers. Some ofthe lawyers are also in full-time employment of the public institutions as their law officers. Theprofile of the legal profession has thus undergone a change.17. The Government or the public body represents public interests, and whoever is in charge ofrunning their affairs, is no more than a trustee or a custodian of the public interests. The protectionof the public interests to the maximum extent and in the best possible manner is his primary duty.The public bodies are, therefore, under an obligation to the society to take the best possible steps tosafeguard its interests. This obligation imposes on them the duty to engage the most competentservants, agents., advisers, spokesmen and representatives for conducting their affairs. Hence, inthe selection of their lawyers, they are duty-bound to make earnest efforts to find the best fromamong those available at the particular time. This is more so because the claims of and against thepublic bodies are generally monetarily substantial and socially crucial with far-reachingconsequences.18. The mode of appointment of lawyers for the public bodies, therefore, has to be in conformitywith the obligation cast on them to select the most meritorious. An open invitation to the lawyers tocompete for the posts is by far the best mode of such selection. But sometimes the best may notcompete or a competent candidate may not be available from among the competitors. In suchcircumstances, the public bodies may resort to other methods such as inviting and appointing thebest available, although he may not have applied for the post. Whatever the method adopted, it mustbe shown that the search for the meritorious was undertaken and the appointments were made onlyon the basis of the merit and not for any other consideration.19. It would be evident from Chapter V of the said Manual that to appoint the Chief StandingCounsel, the Standing Counsel and the. Government Advocate, Additional Government Advocate,Deputy Government Advocate and Assistant Government Advocate, the State Government is underno obligation to consult even its Advocate-General much less the Chief Justice or any of the judgesof the High Court or to take into consideration, the views of any committee that " may" beconstituted for the purpose. The State Government has a discretion. It may or may not ascertain theState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/8views of any of them while making the said appointments. Even where it chooses to consult them,their views are not binding on it. The appointments may, therefore, be made on considerations otherthan merit and there exists no provision to prevent such appointments. The method of appointmentis indeed not calculated to ensure that the meritorious alone will always be appointed or that theappointments made will not be on considerations other than merit. In the absence of guidelines, theappointments may be made purely on personal or political considerations, and be arbitrary. Thisbeing so those who come to be appointed by such arbitrary procedure can hardly complain if thetermination of their appointment is equally arbitrary. Those who come by the back door have to goby the same door. This is more so when the order of appointment itself stipulates that theappointment is terminable at any time without assigning any reason. Such appointments are made,accepted and understood by both sides to be purely professional engagements till they last. The factthat they are made by public bodies cannot vest them with additional sanctity. Every appointmentmade to a public office, howsoever made, is not necessarily, vested with public sanctity. There is,therefore, no public interest involved in: saving all appointments irrespective of their mode. Fromthe inception some engagements and contracts may be the product of the operation of the spoilssystem. There need be no legal anxiety to save them.20. As the facts narrated earlier show, out of 26 respondents-law officers, the period of contract ofnine of them had expired and they were continued till further orders. The remaining seventeen hadcontinued after the expiry of their initial term without even formal orders of extension. In otherwords, none of the 26 officers had any right to hold the office on the date of their removal, evenunder the initial terms of appointment which stipulated the contractual period. This is apart fromthe fact that the terms of the contracts also provided that the appointment could be terminated atany time without assigning reason. The reliance placed by the respondents in this behalf onShrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P. 1 is misplaced for the obvious reason that the decision relates tothe appointment of the District Government Counsel and the Additional/Assistant DistrictGovernment Counsel who are the law officers appointed by the State Government to conduct civil,criminal and revenue cases in any court other than the High Court. Their appointments are madethrough open competition from among those who are eligible for appointment and strictly on thebasis of merit as evidenced by the particulars of their practice, opinions of the District Magistrateand the District Judge and also after taking into consideration their character and conduct. Theirappointment is in the first instance for one year. It is only after their satisfactory performanceduring that period that a deed of engagement is given to them, and even then the engagement is tobe for a term not exceeding three years. The renewal of their further term again depends upon thequality of work and conduct, capacity as a lawyer, professional conduct, public reputation in general,and character and integrity as certified by the District Magistrate and the District Judge. For thesaid purpose, the District Magistrate and the District Judge are required to maintain a character rolland a record of the work done by the officer and the capacity displayed by him in discharge of thework. His work is also subject to strict supervision. The shortcomings in the work are required to bebrought to the notice of the Legal Remembrancer. It will thus be seen that the appointment of thetwo sets of officers, viz., the Government Counsel in the High Court with whom we are concerned,and the District Government Counsel with whom the said decision was concerned, are made bydissimilar procedures. The latter are not appointed as a part of the spoils system. Having beenselected on merit and for no other consideration, they are entitled to continue in their office for theState Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/9period of the contract of their engagement and they can be removed only for valid reasons. Thepeople are interested in their continuance for the period of their contracts and in theirnon-substitution by those who may come in through the spoils system. It is in these circumstancesthat this Court held that the wholesale termination of their services was arbitrary and violative ofArticle 14 of the Constitution. The ratio of the said decision can hardly be applied to theappointments of the law officers in the High Court whose appointment itself was arbitrary and wasmade in disregard of Article 14 of the Constitution as pointed out above. What is further, since theappointment of District Government Counsel is made strictly on the basis of comparative merits andafter screening at different levels, the termination of their services is not consistent with the publicinterests. We are, therefore of the view that the High Court committed a patent error of law insetting aside the order dated July 23, 1990 terminating the services of the respondents-law officers.21. Coming now to the High Court's order setting aside the government order dated May 26, 1990 bywhich the Government had abolished the system of Brief Holders, and instead the power was givento the Legal Remembrancer to appoint special counsel for special matters, we are of the view thatthe High Court has committed a still graver error. As has been pointed out above, Chapter VI of thesaid Manual deals with the system of appointing a panel of Brief Holders in the High Court. Theappointment of the lawyers on the panel of Brief Holders is made by the State Government only inconsultation with the Advocate-General who is its own officer and from among the advocates of theHigh Court who have completed a minimum of five years practice at the Bar. The selection of BriefHolders is not made after open competition. Their appointment is purely at the discretion of theState Government. The Brief Holders are further appointed to handle that work which cannot beattended to by the Government Advocate and Chief Standing Counsel. No salary or any other kind ofmonthly remuneration is payable to them. They are paid per brief handled by them. They are notbarred from private practice or from accepting cases against the Government. It will thus beapparent that their appointment is in supernumerary capacity. It is necessitated because there maybe work which cannot be attended to by the Government Advocate and the Chief Standing Counsel.They are not assured of any regular work much less any regular fee or remuneration. They get briefsonly if the Government Advocate and Chief Standing Counsel are overworked and not otherwise.They are like ad hoc counsel engaged for doing a particular work when available. Their onlyqualification is that they are on the panel of the counsel to be so appointed for handling the surpluswork. We are, therefore, at a loss to understand as to how any fault can be found with theGovernment if the Government has now thought it fit to abolish the said system and to appoint eachtime special counsel for special cases in their place.22. It is evident from the tenor of the High Court judgment that the Legal Remembrancer has beenmade a special target and has been treated almost like the villain of the piece. The judgment ignoresthat the Legal Remembrancer as a responsible officer and part of the Government always had a roleto play in the appointments of the counsel, in the distribution of the work among them and also insupervising their work and in sanctioning their bills. For this purpose, we have referred to therelevant provisions of Chapters V, VI and VII of the Manual in extenso Even a cursory reading of thesaid chapters will show that no material additional power has been vested in him by theGovernment on account of the present measures. In any case, if the Government has chosen to doso, the Legal Remembrancer can hardly be blamed for the same. Certainly he does not deserve theState Of U.P vs U.P.

The comments and observationsmade against him are, therefore, both unjustified and unfortunate.23. In the result, we set aside the judgment of the High Court and declare that both the orders datedJuly 23, 1990 and May 26, 1990 are valid and proper. We further hold that the termination of theappointment of the respondents-law officers was valid and proper. We also hold that the directiongiven by the High Court to the Government to continue the system of Brief Holders is unjustifiedand the same stands quashed. We also set aside the order of the High Court quashing the freshappointments and directing payments to the officers whose appointments were terminated. Theappeals are allowed accordingly. However, in the circumstances of the case, there shall be no orderas to costs.State Of U.P vs U.P. State Law Officers Assn on 25 January, 1993Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/1057041/11
