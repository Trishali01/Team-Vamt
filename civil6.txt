Many intervention applications have also been filed with prayers therein thatthey too be impleaded as petitioners to the writ applications since they have common cause andrelief. All have a common grievance against the declaration of the said result in the background thatthe examination conducted by the Commission has not been fair in the sense that many a questionswhich were set for the PT Examination had either wrong answers or were wrong questions, at timesverging on absurdity or even a right question had a wrong answer provided in the master answersheet.2. There is unanimity amongst the petitioners that any declaration of result based on such questionbank set by so-called panel of experts cannot form the basis for testing the knowledge of thecandidates in a fair and square manner, even if it is for the preliminary examination. For after allqualifying in the preliminary examination is going to form the basis for enabling a candidate to sitfor the mains examination. Their entire career is therefore jeoparidised because of the so-called actof the BPSC which has been labeled as callous in approach in conducting such an importantexamination.3. From the pleadings it is evident that a lot of hue and cry was raised, which compelled therespondent BPSC to examine the questions as well as the model answers and even BPSC agreed that8 of the questions out of 150 questions were required to be deleted for re-evaluation purposes andthey were willing to declare the result on the basis of 142 questions only. This, however, does notsatisfy the petitioners and they insist on either cancellation of the preliminary examination orreducing the entry level cut off marks by as many questions / marks which were found to beerroneous.4. Several instances have been cited in the affidavits filed by the various petitioners with modelanswers provided by the BPSC to strengthen their cases for serious re-look at the declared preliminary examination results. The Court examined those questions closelyand there was near unanimity that the questions which had been set up by the so-called experts and model answers given to those set of questions by the question setters did requirea re-look. It was in this background that vide order dated 9.9.2011 a direction was issued upon theCommission to take help of another set of experts, examine all the questions and model answersafresh, taking into consideration the objections raised by the candidates either through the presentwrit applications or even objections filed directly with the Commission.5. Counsel for the Commission did agree to accept the direction of this Court and revert on the issuewithin the given time frame prayed on their behalf. The matter was finally placed by way of anaffidavit filed on behalf of the Commission where they did agree that some of the earlier questionswere wrong questions or the answer given to the right question was a wrong answer and they arewilling to abide by any direction which may come from the Court on the given set of facts. They,Manoj Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 January, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138670733/36however, do take a stand that cancellation of the preliminary examination and re-conducting thesame may not be a practical and prudent exercise because holding such an examination of suchmagnitude is not an easy exercise. Further it is going to delay the recruitment process, which hasalready been delayed for three batches as the present examination is being conducted for the 52ndto 55th batch.6. After the affidavit on behalf of the Commission was filed, divergent kind of statements emergedon behalf of the petitioners. Though by and large the majority are not in favour of cancellation of theexamination as a whole now but they insist that since a number of questions or answers were foundto be erroneous, the Commission should be directed to reduce the present cut off marks by as manymarks and allow all those candidates who come within the newly fixed cut off marks to appear in themains examination. For after all, it is only a question of giving an opportunity to a larger section ofthe students to establish their credibility as well as their selectibility on the posts which have beenadvertised, on the basis of the mains examination, followed by interview which is still to come. Sincemany a candidates are going to become over-age, this may be their last opportunity to have a go at aGovernment job and their plight should also be taken into consideration by taking a broader view ofthe issue.7. In support of the reduction of cut off marks by as many questions which have been found to beerroneous, reliance has been placed on the decision rendered in the case of Akshey Lal Pandit v.State of Bihar, 2011 (3) PLJR 258.The said case related to selection of Civil Judges of Junior Division, which also became a subjectmatter of controversy since large number of questions were found to be erroneous.Keeping in mind the acceptance of the so-called error in the questions set by the Commission, adirection was issued by the Division Bench, upon the Commission to reduce the qualifying cut offmarks by 25 marks and allow all the candidates thereafter to sit in the mains examination.8. Yet another decision which has been relied is the case of Pankaj Sharma v. State of Jammu andKashmir and others, (2008) 4 SCC 273. This is a matter which arose from a civil servicesexamination conducted by J & K Public Service Commission.9. The present controversy which has arisen for consideration by this Court is not the first of itskind. BPSC has been dragged to Court on earlier occasions also because they have failed to couduct afool-proof examination without any surrounding controversy with regard to the questions set or themanner in which results have been declared. On earlier occasions there were even insinuations andallegations of malpractices etc. which, however, is not the issue in the present set of writapplications. The controversy is limited to the correctness of the questions which were set and theso-called model answers provided by the experts based on which the results of the preliminaryexamination came to be declared.Manoj Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 January, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138670733/3710. BPSC is a constitutional body and it has an obligation to ensure holding of a free and fairexamination, maintaining the utmost standards and probity without giving any leeway for any kindof doubt, dispute or controversy being raised with regard to results of any examination conducted bythem. The Court however is not unmindful of the fact that the Commision has no mechanism to setquestions for various examinations, which they hold and they have to rely on outside agencies or apanel of so-called experts, whose services are taken from time to time. Unfortunately in the presentcase, BPSC is facing a flak not because of any failure on their part but because of certain omission orfailure on the part of the experts, who provided the question bank as well as the so-called modelanswers. But, it is the credibility of the BPSC which is at stake as they are the body saddled withresponsibility to hold such examination to fill up public / civil posts under the constitutionalprovision. The Court has been told that to prevent any leakage of question papers they cannotscrutinize the correctness of the questions or answers until examination is held.11. It may be so, therefore the Court would want BPSC to review the list of so-called experts andweed out the elements who have caused such embarrassment and litigation, at least for the futureexaminations. It will be in their interest to do so.12. Coming to the question whether the contention of the petitioners that the present cut offmarks/qualifying marks should be reduced by the number of questions which have been found to beerroneous and be made the basis for declaration of the result afresh or whether the evaluationshould be re-done on the basis of total correct answers which the Commission has now zeroed downas per the second experts panel opinion, is the crux of the dispute now.13. This Court does not find any rationale in the demand for reducing the minimum qualifyingmarks by as many marks on the basis of questions which have been found to be wrong in the presentcase, by the second expert committee because the final evaluation has to be made on the basis of thefinal tally of correct set of questions which now remain. Evaluation has to be made across the boardon the basis of the correct answers, to correct questions, which have to be considered now. Reducingthe cut-off marks across the board will bring within its ambit a large number of candidates by givingthem a kind of unfair advantage without any scientific basis defeating the very objective of holding apreliminary examination.14. In the opinion of this Court, the proper mechanism to be adopted would be to carry out a freshevaluation of all the answer sheets of the candidates who have participated in the preliminaryexaminations by weeding out the wrong questions which have now been accepted to be wrong by the2nd expert committee and which the Commission has gracefully accepted by way of the affidavitfiled by them on 11.11.2011. The details of the questions which have been found to be erroneous orwrong or the questions whose answers were found to be wrong have been stated in detail in thesecond supplementary counter affidavit.To be definitive as to the exact stand of the BPSC, their assertion made in the supplementarycounter affidavit is being reproduced here for ready reference:Manoj Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 January, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138670733/38"4. That accordingly in compliance of this Hon`ble Courts order dated 9.9.2011, a Committee ofexperts comprising of 13 very senior retired and working Professors of Patna University and MagadhUniversity was constituted. The Committee of experts reviewed all the 150 questions of Generalstudies paper and determined their answers. While doing so, they also considered each and everysuggestion given by the writ petitioners as also suggestions of the candidates who had filedrepresentations in the Commission. The new Expert Committee differed from old one in respect ofanswers of the following questions of booklet series A:-1. Question No.6:- Minerals are (A) Liquids (B) Inorganic Solids (C ) Gases (D) All of the aboveSome candidates have referred to the NCERT Text Book, which suggests option (D) whereas as perReference Books the answer should be Option (B). In view of this ambiguity the experts haverecommended to delete this question. The previous expert committee had suggested option B ascorrect answer.2. Question No. 30:- Till 2010, which State Governments have provided 50 percent reservation forwomen in local bodies? (A) Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajashthan (B) Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, HimachalPradesh (C) Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala (D) Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh Somecandidates have suggested that till 2010, 50% reservation to women in civil bodies was available inKerala also whereas Option B decided by the Commission as correct answer does not include Kerala.The new expert committee suggested that till 2010, 50% reservation to women in civil bodies wasavailable in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Kerala. As none of the alternativeoptions include all the four States, so all options are wrong. Hence, they have recommended deletingthis question also.3. Question No.79:- Major Source of oceanic salinity is (A) rivers (B) land (C) wind (D) ash fromvolcanoes The new expert committee has suggested option (B) instead of Option (A) as suggested bythe erstwhile expert committee.4. Question No.103: Commercial sources of energy purely consist of (A) Power, Coal, Oil, Gas,Hydroelectricity and uranium (B) Coal, Oil, Firewood, Vegetable Waste and Agricultural Waste (C )Power, Coal, Animal dung and Firewood (D) Coal, Gas, Oil and Firewood This question had beendeleted on the suggestion of the previous expert committee. However, the new expert committee hassuggested option (A) as the correct answer.5. Question No. 113:- Consider the following about the Rolling Plan I.

However, the new expert committee has suggestedoption (D) as the correct answer.Manoj Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 January, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138670733/396. Question No.115: Patna International Airport is directly connected with (A) Kathmandu (Nepal),New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Lucknow, Varanasi and Ranchi (B) Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Dhaka(C) Islamabad, Dhaka and Bengaluru (D) Washington, Dhaka and Chennai The new expertcommittee has suggested deletion of this question as all the four options are wrong.5. That thus the new expert committee agreed with the suggestions of the previous expert committeeto delete question Nos. 91, 99, 104, 109, 116 and 122 (six questions) while they have suggested thatquestion nos. 103 and 113 should not be deleted. They have suggested correct answers for the abovetwo questions as stated herein above. The new experts have also differed from the previous expertsin respect of the answer of question no.79 as stated herein above. However, the new expertcommittee has suggested deletion of three additional questions, i.e. question Nos. 6, 30 and 115finding the objections of the candidates to be justified.6. That in so far as the present writ petition is concerned, the writ petitioners had contended thatQuestion nos. 91, 103, 104, 109 and 113 of Set A equivalent to Question nos. 121, 133, 134, 139, 143 ofSet B respectively has wrongly been deleted which have a definite answer. The Expert Committee soconstituted in so far as a question no.103 and 113 agrees with the view of the writ petitioners andsuggested that Question No.103 and 113 should not be deleted but suggested deletion of QuestionNos.91, 104 and 109 of Set A as was suggested by previous expert committee.7. That the writ petitioners have further contended that Question Nos. 6, 14, 30, 45 and 50 of Set Aequivalent to Question Nos. 36, 44, 60, 75 and 80 of Set B respectively has different answers to thatwhat has been fixed by the B.P.S.C. The Committee of Experts has suggested to delete QuestionNo.6, agreed with the option D as the correct answer of Question no.14 as was fixed by theCommission upon suggestion of the earlier Committee of Experts, has suggested to delete QuestionNo.30, has agreed with Option A as the correct answer of Question No.45 as was fixed by theCommission upon suggestion of the earlier Committee of Experts and has agreed with Option D asthe correct answer of Question No.50 as was fixed by the Commission upon suggestion of the earlierCommittee of Experts.8. That besides the new Committee of Experts has also suggested deleting Question No.115 as wassuggested by the writ petitioners to be deleted.9. That it would thus be manifest that the new Committee of Experts have suggested to deletequestion Nos. 6, 30, 91, 99, 104, 109, 115, 116 and 122 (9 questions) of Set A and differed with theviews of previous Experts in respect of answer of Question No.79 of Set A as has been stated aboveand have suggested Option B to be the correct answer instead of Option A as was suggested by theearlier Expert Committee."15. When the Court questioned the learned senior counsel representing the Commission as to whatwould be the fall-out if the evaluaition of the answer sheets is made now by deleting nine questionsand accepting two quesitons with correct and definite answers, on the basis of some exercise carriedout by the Commission, they come with a rough figure that 915 candidates who have already beendeclared successful on the basis of earlier evaluation will stand ousted and many more newManoj Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 January, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138670733/40candidates would be declared to be successful.16. But once a candidate has been declared successful, his ouster from the list of successfulcandidates will generate another kind of litigation which the BPSC wants to avoid in the interest ofcutting down further delay in conducting the mains examination. They are therefore willing to retainthem and also allow the would be successful candidates to come in. It is also their stand that therewill be a reduction of marks on the present cut off marks which has been fixed on the basis of earlierdeclaration of result and that will bring in more candidates in the ambit of qualified persons undervarious categories. In fact, despite so-called ratio of 10 percent which has been fixed by the BPSC forallowing the successful candidates to appear in the mains examination the total candidates whowould be allowed to appear in the mains examination is going to get enhanced by some morepercentage points bringing within its fold a few thousand more candidates. They are, however,willing to accommodate all those candidates now, if it allows the controversy to rest and theCommission to go ahead with conduct of the mains examinastion after carrying out there-evaluation.17. Though in the judgment relied by the petitioners which is the case of Akshey Lal Pandit (supra)the Court decided to reduce the minimum eligibility by 25 marks to sit for the main examination butthat was based in the given facts and circumstances and taking into consideration that the totalnumber of applicants for the vacancy of judicial officers was about 21000 only but in the presentcase the number of applicants runs into lakhs and such an approach would frustrate the very objectof holding a preliminary examination to weed out the non-serious students from the contention.18. A controversy of similar kind had once arisen way back in the case of Ganesh Prasad Yadav v.State of Bihar, 1995 (2) PLJR 170. The Division Bench after going into the details of the said disputehad opined as under:"36. No doubt, there are mistakes in the alternative answers or responses to the fourquestions, but on that basis it cannot be said that the Commission adopted any unfairmeans or acted in an unfair manner, on the other hand, the aforesaid mistakesappear to have been committed by the experts to whom the work of setting ofquestions and their suggestive answers was entrusted. It cannot be said that therewas unfair treatment to the non-selectees in particular. All the candidates includingthe successful candidates have answered the same set of questions and in that view ofthe matter either all the candidates have suffered equally or took advantages of wrongsuggestive answers. In that view of the matter, in spite of the aforesaid errors, in myview, it would not be proper to quash the preliminary test for the aforesaid defects."(emphasis mine)19. Similar is the situation in the present case as well. The advantage or disadvantage from a wrongquestion or a wrong answer would be there against one and all because it cannot be said thatsuccessful candidates managed to hit the bull's eye with a correct answer even though the questionwas wrong or vice versa.Manoj Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 January, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138670733/4120. The Court therefore comes to a considered opinion that a fairer approach to the whole problemwould be by permitting BPSC to carry out a fresh evaluation of all the answer sheets on the basis oftheir stand emerging from the opinion of the second expert group. If such an exercise is permittedthen it will amount to a fair evaluation of all the candidates without giving any unfair advantage toeither successful candidates or the unsuccessful ones because they will all be tested on a commonplatform. In fact this is one of the reasons why this Court is not willing to accept the submission ofsome of the counsels that as many marks should be added to all the candidates treating them ascorrect answers to the incorrect questions. Such an approach will make no difference to the finalstanding of the successful candidates whose results have been declared.21. In the totality therefore, the Court comes to a considered conclusion that the BPSC should nowre-declare the result of the preliminary examination after a fresh evaluation on the basis of therecommendations of the second expert committee and that should form the basis for conduct of themains examination which is yet to follow.22. It is made clear that none of the successful candidates earlier declared successful on the basis ofdeclaration of the result would be ousted from the list of such candidates who will be entitled to sitfor the mains examination. If the exercise brings in more candidates within the zone of successfulcandidates by being permitted to sit for the mains examination, so be it, but the exercise shall not bedone to the detriment of any of the successful candidates whose results have already been declaredearlier.23. These writ applications are allowed in terms of the direction issued above.24. Some concerted effort was made on behalf of some of the counsels representing the petitionersto persist with their submission that there are still some mistakes with the answers or the questionsdespite the scrutiny by the second expert committee. With due respect to such counsels, thosearguments are for the sake of arguments because the answers which they try to demonstrate beforethe Court are based on some publication made by the NCERT which by itself cannot be treated to bethe final referral material for all the questions on the subject, which became the basis for testing theawareness of the students participating in the preliminary examination.25. Let it be clarified that the order passed in these bunch of writ applications shall apply to all thecandidates who have participated in the preliminary examination irrespective of the fact whetherthey have approached the Court or filed interlocutory applications to be impleaded as petitionersand have not been allowed, looking at the nature of the relief so granted.26. Before parting the Court would also like to record that the view expressed by this Court findssupport from the judgment of a Division Bench delivered in the case of Bihar Public ServiceCommission v. Mukesh Kumar Singh, reported in 2009 (3) PLJR 878.rkp                                        ( Ajay Kumar Tripathi, J.)Manoj Kumar & Ors vs The State Of Bihar & Ors on 4 January, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/138670733/42
