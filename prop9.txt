This is defendant's appeal under Section 96 of Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter referred to as"CPC") arising from judgment and decree dated 05.05.2015 passed by Sri Gopal Upadhayay, CivilJudge (Senior Division), Allahabad in Original Suit No. 513 of 1989 (Jagatguru Shankaracharya,Jyotishpeethadheeshwar Sri Swami Swaroopa Nand Saraswati Vs. Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati).2. Plaintiff-respondent (hereinafter referred to as 'plaintiff') instituted Original Suit No. 513 of 1989,seeking permanent injunction restraining defendant appellant (hereinafter referred to as 'appellant')from being installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth Badrika AshramHimalaya (hereinafter referred to as "Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth") and proclaim himself as JagatSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/1Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and restrain from holding Danda, ChhatraChanwar and Singhasan of the office of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth.Plaint Case3. Plaint case set up by plaintiff, vide plaint dated 10.11.1989 is that plaintiff is duly installed JagatGuru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth from 07.12.1973 and performing religious dutiesand functions provided in "Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan", the books prescribed to regulateand govern functioning of Jagat Guru Shankaracharya.4. Several centuries ago, Jagat Guru Shankaracharya propounded theory of absolute Monism, basedon the authority of Upnishads. His philosophy succeeded in combating Buddhism andre-establishing religion of Vedas. He preached Non-dualistic Philosophy. He established four Mathsas Monasteries in four extremities of India namely, Jyotirmath near Badrika Ashram, (Badri Nath inPauri Garhwal) (Now Chamoli Garhwal) in the North; Sharda Math in West (Gujarat); ShringeriMath in Mysore (South) and Goverdhan Math at Puri (East). He placed each one of aforesaid Mathsin the charge of one of his principal ascetic disciples. He also prescribed Rules and Regulationsgoverning aforesaid four Maths in booklets named 'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan' written byhim. Adi Shankracharya in the said two booklets prescribed territorial jurisdiction, qualifications forappointment and dethroning a Head of Math who was to be known as 'Shankracharya' of that'Peeth'.5. Primary object of establishing these Maths was to encourage and foster Vedic teachings bymaintaining a competent line of teachers to impart religious instructions to disciples and others;manage and strengthen doctrine of Vedic teachings so as to prevent any possibility of Vedic religionbeing affected by Philosophies, foreign to it.6. The two books "Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan" (later on also called as "Books of Command")are considered to have highest authority on the subject, being directly laid down by propounder ofMath/Peeth, i.e. Adi Shankaracharya.7. Requisite qualifications for a Shankaracharya are contained in the following two verses of"Mathamnaya":^^'kqfpftfrfUnz;ks osn osnkaxkfn fo'kkjn%] ;ksxK% loZ'kkL=.kka l enLFkkueokIuqxkr~A mDr y{k.k lEiUu% lekPpsUeIrhB HkkXHkosr~] vU;Fkk :<+ihBksÂ·fifuxzgjkseuhf"k.kke~AA** "He who is unsullied, has subdued the senses, is wellversed in the Vedas and Vedangas, and is conversant with the application of theshastras can obtain my Peeth otherwise, one devoid of these merits even if installed,is to be deposed by the wise and learned."(English translation by Court)Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/28. The commands in the aforesaid books are mandatory and to be strictly followed. Besides, therehave been long established customs and traditions in all the four Maths/Peeths, separate,independent and distinct, to install highly learned Sanyasis, who possess all qualifications/qualitieslaid down in 'Mathamnaya ' and 'Mahanushasan' as 'Peethadheeshwar'. These customs andtraditions are being followed and observed without least deviation. In Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth,according to aforesaid Rules and Regulations prescribed in 'Mathamnaya', forty one learned andcompetent Sanyasis having requisite qualifications/qualities were installed to the Headship ofPeeth, one after another. They performed duties, responsibilities and managed affairs of saidMath/Peeth in the manner prescribed in the above books.9. For a period of about 165 years (prior to 1941) i.e. since around 1776 A.D.,Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth remained without a Head. In 1941, three Shankaracharya of Shringeri,Sharda and Govardhan Math/Peeth, Rulers of various States, learned people and Sanyasis etc.,authorised a registered institution known as "Bharat Dharma Mahamandal, Banaras" (nowVaranasi) (hereinafter referred to as "B.D.M., VNS") to search a Sanyasi, satisfying qualifications/qualities prescribed in above books of command so as to install 'Shankaracharya' of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth with an object to restore above Peeth/Math to its prestine stage and prestige.10. Late Brahmanand Saraswati, a great learned Sansyasi was chosen and installed as Head ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth by "B.D.M., VNS". Above selection was approved by aforesaid threeShankaracharyas of other three Peeths, Sansayis and other learned men and followers of Vedicteachings. 'B.D.M., VNS' also executed a deed of declaration of trust, dated 11th May, 1941 (BaisakhSudi 15 Samvat 1998). Entire land and site of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, Pauri Garhwal, includingland and Ashram at Banaras (Varanasi) was placed under Trust of "Jagat Guru ShankaracharyaSwami Brahmanand Saraswati" with the conditions mentioned in the said deed. Late BrahmanandSaraswati performed his functions with great ability, resulting in reviving prestige ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth among people residing in northern India and became very famous. Peoplemade generous donations of moveables and immovables so that there may not be any financialscarcity in management of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth as well as Sanyasis attached to it. LateBrahmanand Saraswati managed property of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth as Trustee thereof and as aSanyasi who renounced the world and devoted to religion.11. Adi Shankaracharya had oriented principles of Trust in "Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan" andsame continued, as it is, in all four Math/Peeths.12. Late Brahmanand Saraswati breathed his last on 20.5.1953. Then a question arose about hissuccessor. While three Shankaracharyas, were pondering over the matter, it was claimed that a 'Will'was executed by Late Brahmanand Saraswati, nominating four persons as successors, namely, (a)Ramji Triapthi (subsequently known as Shanta Nand Saraswati) (b) Dwarika Prasad Shastri (c)Swami Vishnu Deva Nand Saraswati (d) Swami Parmanand Saraswati. According to 'Will', they wereto succeed, one after another, and name of Ramji Tripathi alias Shanta Nand Saraswati wasmentioned at first place. However, claim of Ramji Tripathi alias Shanta Nand Saraswati to succeedMath/Peeth as Shankaracharya was rejected by three Shankarachayas of other Peeths, learned,Pandits and Sanyasis. In fact, 'Will' was not executed by late Brahmanand Saraswati on the basisSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/3whereof Ramji Tripathi alias Shanta Nand Saraswati staked his claim. Three Shankarachayas andothers rejected claim of Ramji Tripathi alias Shanta Nand Saraswati on the ground of incompetence,since he had not previously taken any education and till few years back, he was working as a BookBinder in Geeta Press, Gorakhpur. He was not conversant with Sanskrit Language and incapable tointerpret Vedic philosophy etc. Plaintiff asserted in para 22 of plaint that said 'Will' dated 18.12.1952was a forged and fabricated document for the reason that it was not executed by Late BrahmanandSaraswati and circumstances under which its execution was alleged, also made it suspicious. It wasnot a genuine 'Will'. Moreover, Late Brahmanand Saraswati was not competent to make any 'Will' ornominate by 'Will' any successor(s) as Peethadheeshwar. He could not and did not own or possessany property of his own. Properties of Math/Peeth were held by him in Trust and not as personalproperty, hence could not have been disposed of through 'Will'. He also did not possess sounddisposing mind at the time of execution of 'Will', when alleged 'Will' was executed on 18.12.1952. Hehad been suffering with sleeplessness and other ailments for a long time, preceding the date ofalleged execution of 'Will'. Hence, it was illegal and invalid and did not have effect of making RamjiTripathi and other three nominees, entitled to become Shankaracharya or clothe themselves withany right or title to hold and deal with the properties of Math/Peeth. According to Rules, directions,customs and traditions of Peeth, and further directions contained in declaration/deed dated11.5.1941, successor to the office of Shankaracharaya had to be chosen by a body of learned men ofKashi Vidvat Parishad, a registered body (hereinafter referred to as 'K.V.P.') and to be approved bythree Maths/Peeths. K.V.P. and other Shankaracharyas did not recognize alleged 'Will', henceneither selected nor installed him as 'Shankaracharya'. Instead, Swami Krishna Bodhashram wasinstalled on Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on or about 25.6.1953 and he continued to hold office till hisdeath on 10.9.1973.13. Swami Krishna Bodhashram fell ill in September 1973, hence appointed plaintiff to performduties of the seat and manage affairs of Math/Peeth during his ailment. However, he breathed hislast at Delhi on 10.9.1973. Before his death, he proposed name of plaintiff for installing as"Shankaracharaya". Again, question of installation of "Shankaracharya" of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeethwas considered by three "Shankaracharayas" of different Maths/Peeths and other learned persons.They selected and appointed plaintiff as "Shankaracharaya" of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, since hepossessed all qualifications prescribed in 'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan'. Installation ceremonyof plaintiff was held at Delhi on 7.12.1973 in which 'Shankaracharaya' of Sharda Peeth andGowardhan Peeth were personally present and offered Pattabhishek to plaintiff. Shankaracharya ofShringeri Peeth sent his representative who offered Patta Vastra, on his behalf, in the saidceremony. Besides, several other Sanyasis, Grihasths, Pandits, Scholars were also present andparticipated in aforesaid ceremony. All necessary religious ceremonies were performed. Afterinstallation of plaintiff, a procession was taken out from Gandhi Maidan, Delhi in which all threeShankaracharyas including plaintiff joined. Procession terminated at Azmal Khan Park of KarolBagh and turned into a huge sabha, wherein various religious institutions of Delhi, Haryana, UttarPradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal including followers and leaders of Jain Religion,Mandleshwars, Sanyasis and Grihasths welcomed and acclaimed plaintiff as 'Shankaracharya' ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and offered their homage. Since installation on 7.12.1973, plaintiff as'Shankaracharya' of said Peeth is performing duties and discharging responsibilities in the saidcapacity i.e. Jyotish-Peethadhishwar.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/414. Plaintiff was attracted to asceticism at a very early age of 13 years. He studied Sanskrit atNarsinghpur and Kashi. In 1941 he joined Sanskrit Pathshala at village Rampur District Ghazipur.Before taking Danda (Sanyas), he accompanied many great religious and spiritual Sanyasis andYogis namely Sri Vallabhanand, Sri Oriya Baba, Sri Karpatriji, Late Sri Krishna Bodhaharamji, SriMaheshwarnandji, Sri Adwaitnand and Sri Akhandanand etc. Plaintiff learnt and discussed withaforesaid religious persons Vedas, Vedangas, Upnishads, Shastras, etc. His quest for knowledgebrought him to Late Shankaracharya Brahmanand Saraswati in 1950 and he is Chela, senior toRamji Tripathi alias Shantanand Saraswati. Plaintiff became Dandi Sanyasi and was introduced toDasnami order. After learning religious philosophy for sometimes, plaintiff left Late ShankaracharyaBrahmanand Saraswati to propagate Shankar philosophy and Sanatan Dharma, Hindu religion.Plaintiff mostly propagates Vedantic teachings in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar andBengal. Plaintiff has a large number of followers in the aforesaid States. In May, 1964 plaintiffestablished "Adhyatmic Utthan Mandal", a registered body at Paramhansi Ganga in Distt.Narsinghpur (Madhya Pradesh), having branches in Bengal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat and isrun by plaintiff's followers to impart religious instructions according to Sanatan Dharma. Plaintiffopened several other institutions to impart religious teachings. Ramji Tripathi alias ShantanandSaraswati, wrongly and illegally, claimed himself Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on thebasis of a forged and fictitious will dated 18.12.1952, alleged to have been executed by LateBrahmanand Saraswati. Remaining three nominees, namely, Dwarika Prasad Shastri, Swami VishnuDeva Nand Saraswati and Swami Parmanand Saraswati also had successive claim, watching exit ofnominees, earlier to his name, also threatened to assume office of Shankaracharya ofBadrikasharam Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth.15. Plaintiff was compelled to file suit no. 1-A of 1974 Jagat Guru Shankaracharya JyotishPeethadheswar Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati versus Ramji Tripathi and 3 others, in the Court ofDistrict Judge, Seoni. Subsequently, it was transferred to Court of District Judge Allahabad, whosent it to the Court of Civil Judge Allahabad and was assigned ultimately to the Court of AdditionalCivil Judge, Allahabad. Defendants therein with an objective to prolong disposal of aforesaid suitno.1A/1974, filed a revision in this Court against an interlocutory order passed by Additional CivilJudge for recording statement of witnesses. Ramji Tripathi alias Shantanand Saraswati,apprehending trouble to explain about his wrongful activities and competence to hold the office ofShankaracharya and also accounting for huge amount of Trust, withdrawn and misappropriated byhim, executed a deed of relinquishment of said office of Shankaracharya on 28.4.1980 though helegally never held the said office nor was ever installed as Shankaracharya. He was also notcompetent to hold the said office. Without any right or authority he nominated Sri Vishnu DevanandSaraswati to be next Jagat Guru Shankaracharya, ignoring even line of succession stated in thealleged 'Will' dated 18.12.1952. Sri Vishnu Devanand Saraswati was at serial no. 3 in the alleged'Will' and Swami Dwarikeshanand at number two. Without execution of valid 'Will' and evenotherwise, Ramji Tripathi alias Shantanand Saraswati had no right to nominate a person at serialno. 3, bypassing the person mentioned at serial no. 2 in the alleged 'Will' dated 18.12.1952.Dwarikeshanand Saraswati was alive and had taken Sanyas long back. Late Brahmanand Saraswatihad no right to execute a 'Will' creating and formulating line of succession of Shankaracharya and itwas against provisions of 'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan'. In fact, no such 'Will' was executed byhim. Hence, Ramji Tripathi alias Shantanand Saraswati had no right to hold office ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/5Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Therefore, question of relinquishment and nominationof other person by deed dated 28.4.1980 did not arise. In any case, aforesaid nomination was alsowithout any right, authority and against conditions of alleged 'Will' dated 18.12.1952. No right, titleand interest to Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth was ever approved in favour of Vishnudevanand Saraswatiand he was never legally installed to the said office, which is possessed and occupied by plaintiffsince 7.12.1973.16. Vishnudevanand Saraswati died on 1.11.1989. After death of Vishnudevanand Saraswati,appellant started manipulating himself to be installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, though plaintiff was already installed and functioning thereat with duerecognition by all three remaining Shankaracharyas. According to conditions provided in'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan', only one Sanyasi having requisite qualification is entitled to beinstalled as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya and there cannot be more than one Jagat GuruShankaracharya in same Peeth, hence appellant could not have claimed his installation as JagatGuru Shankaracharya, since there was no vacancy. No question could have arisen of his installationin the said office.17. From various newspapers published from 5.11.1989 to 7.11.1989, it had come to notice of plaintiffthat appellant was manipulating his installation as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on15.11.1989 at Alopi Bagh, which will affect and hit religious feelings of plaintiff and Hindu devotees,followers of Vedic and Sanatan Dharma propunded by Adi Guru Shankaracharya. Appellant wasthreatening to do so without any right and authority. He also did not possess requisite qualificationas provided in 'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan' for such installation. In any case, there cannot betwo persons to be installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya in the same Peeth. Appellant, therefore,was not entitled for installation as Shankaracharya, hold and possess Danda, Chhatra, Chanwar andSinghasan of said office. Plaintiff was entitled to restrain appellant, by means of a decree ofpermanent injunction, from being installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and proclaim himself as such and to hold various decorations like Danda,Chhatra, Chanwar and Singhasan etc. of such office. Since appellant was bent upon for hisinstallation as Shankaracharya, hence the suit. Cause of action arose on 7.11.1989 and 8.11.1989when news items were published in newspapers that appellant would be installed asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 15.11.1989, though he had no such right and his actof getting such installation is wholly without jurisdiction. The suit accordingly was filed in the Courtof Civil Judge, Allahabad with the relief as stated above.Amendment of plaint after appellant's installation18. After filing of suit, appellant, however, proceeded to get himself installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Thereafter, by way of amendment, allowed vide Court's order dated22.12.2006, paragraph 44/1 was inserted in the plaint which reads as under:"44/1. That after filing the suit the defendant has been alleging and claiming that he was installed asJagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotishpeeth on 14th November and 15th November, 1989."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/6Appellant's defence in written statement19. Appellant contested the suit by filing written statement dated 12.5.1992. It was pleaded thatplaintiff was never installed Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and never exercised dutiesas such. According to 'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan', plaintiff had no locus standi to encroachupon rights and functions of appellant who was recognized and duly installed as Shankaracharya inthe said Peeth in accordance with norms, customs and usage of Peeth. Establishment of fourMaths/Peeths by Adi Guru Shankaracharya in four extremities in India was not disputed but it wasdenied that affairs of Peeths are governed only by conditions prescribed in the two books'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan'. Shankaracharya of one Peeth can neither have any say norfunction on the Peeth of another Shankaracharya and in this regard following versus have beenquoted in para 2 of written statement:^^7- ijLijfoHkkxs rq izos'kks u dnkpuA ijLijs.k dÃkZO;k vkpk;sZ.k O;ofLFkfr%AA "Acharyas shouldnever interfere in the apportionments (jurisdiction) of each other, they should settle theirobligations mutually."9- ifjozkMk;Ze;kZnka ekedhuka ;Fkkfof/kA prq% ihBkf/kxka lÃkkaiz;qÂ¥~Â¥~;kPp i`Fkd~ i`Fkd~AA"A highly esteemed Sanyasi may acquire power of four seats but he should utilise them separately inaccordance with distinct law made by me, the omniscient Lord."14- ,d ,okfHk"ksP;% L;knUrsy{k.klEer%A rÃkr~ihBs dzes.kSo u cgq;qZT;rs Dofpr~AA** "At lastaccording to Supreme knowledge one should be consecrated on concerned peeth in succession, inany case more than one should not be appointed."(English translation by Court)20. Functional area of Shankaracharya is limited within the boundaries of their respective Peeth.'Mathamnaya' contains Rules which are regulatory in nature. Certain Code of conduct andqualifications have been dealt with in the two books but qualifications mentioned therein are notmandatory. They are only recommendatory and prescribes ideal character of a Shankaracharya.Plaintiff is neither qualified for the office of Shankaracharya nor ever nominated or installed asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. There existed separate customs and traditions in allfour Peeths for selection, nomination and installation of learned 'Sanyasi' as Shankaracharya.Amongst four Peeths, there are fundamental difference with regard to source, terms and conditions,Sampradai (Sect), title, God, Goddess, Acharya, Tirth, Brahmchari, Ved, Mahavakya, Gotra, Areaetc. Shankaracharya of one Peeth cannot become Shankaracharya of another Peeth in anycircumstance, whatsoever. In the deed of declaration dated 11th May, 1941, "B.D.M., V.N.S." andSaints and Sanyasis bestowed title of Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth in accordance with customsand norms upon Late Brahmanand Saraswati. He occupied the seat and functioned to redeem andrestructure the Peeth/Math which had lost and fallen into oblivion in the past 165 years. B.D.M.,V.N.S. did not and could not reserve any power or right in itself or to anybody else for furtherinstallation. Late Brahmanand Saraswati had unrestricted discretion in the matter ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Averments in regard to learning and qualifications of Late BrahmanandSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/7Saraswati as stated in para 11 of plaint are admitted in para 11 of written statement. It is also notdisputed that Brahmanand Saraswati took possession of all properties of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeethwhen installed as Shankaracharya. After death of Brahmanand Saraswati there was no question ofany selection or appointment since Late Brahmanand Saraswati himself appointed, in his lifetime,and nominated Ramji Tripathi alias Swami Shantanand Saraswati as his successor. Plaintiffchallenged 'Will' deed dated 18.12.1952 but lost litigation upto highest Court, cannot raise the sameissue again. Plaintiff has no right to challenge competence of Ramji Tripathi alias SwamiShantanand Saraswati, particularly when tenure is already over and challenge failed in differentproceedings. Late Brahmanand Saraswati possessed considerable cash and personal property of hisown which was never mixed up with the property of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Late BrahmanandSaraswati was best person to judge and assess qualification of his successor and in that view of thematter, nominated Ramji Tripathi alias Swami Shantanand Saraswati as successor toJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Succession passes from Guru to Chela through nomination by PresidingGuru and this custom of successor is also admitted to plaintiff. Swami Krishna Bodhashram wasnever appointed Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth at any point of time. He was not aChela of Late Brahmanand Saraswati. Even otherwise, he lost his claim in Original Suit No.3 of 1963filed in the Court of Civil Judge, Garhwal for declaration of his claim, which was not recognised inthe aforesaid suit decided by 5th Temporary Civil and Sessions Judge, Allahabad. Suit filed byplaintiff is fabricated one and only to gain his private ends. His claim of so-called appointment hasnever been accepted by Court or any other authority. Plaintiff was not even Chela of Late KrishnaBodhashram. No question arose for appointment of Shankaracharya of Jyotishpeeth nor the seatwas ever vacant after death of late Brahmanand Saraswati. Plaintiff was neither competent nor everinstalled as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth nor can claim himself to beShankaracharya of said Peeth in any manner whatsoever. Plaintiff left Brahmanand Saraswati aftersevering all connections, laid another establishment. Swami Shantanand Saraswati relinquishedseat on 22.2.1980. He nominated and appointed Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Swami Shantanand Saraswati held office ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth upto 27.2.1980 and due to old age, considering the qualifications requiredfor the post of Shankaracharya, nominated and installed Swami Vishnudevanand on 28.2.1980.Swami Vishnudevanand held office upto 1.11.1989, when he breathed his last. He was very learnedand qualified Sanyasi for the coveted seat of Shankaracharya. His nomination and installation ofShankaracharya was fully justified by customs, usage and practice. He was recognised by Sanyasis,Grihasths, Pandits and learned Scholars. He was in possession of all the properties ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati found appellant, most suitable andqualified person for installation as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and as suchnominated him vide registered 'Will' dated 17.4.1989. As per norms, customs and usage, prevalentand recognised by Peeth for the said office, appellant was installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth with all religious formalities, due ceremonies and requirements on 14thand 15th November, 1989. He got possession of entire property of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth andsince then, functioning and discharging duties of the said office. Installation of appellant is valid andotherwise claim set up by plaintiff is false, baseless and fabricated. No cause of action has arisen toplaintiff to file the suit on the basis of news published in newspapers. Succession had alreadyproceeded from the 'Will' and nomination. Appellant is a qualified Sanyasi, well versed in Vedas,Darshan, Vedanta, Yoga, Vendangas and Adhyatamik (spiritual) philosophy etc. He is capable ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/8maintaining high prestige of the seat and able to preach Shastras and religious philosophy toSanyasis and Grihasthas. His religious attainments are well acclaimed and beyond doubt. Besideshis attainments, his academic qualifications are (a) M.A. in Hindi and Philosophy (b) Vedantacharya(c) Pursharthacharya (d) Sahityaratna (e) Sanskrit Prabhakar (f) Ph.D. in Shankar Vedanta. He alsopossesses knowledge of Purusharth. He worked as Head of Department of Vedanta Vibhag in SriJyotish Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya (at Allahabad). His installation as Shankaracharya is mostappropriate and appreciable. Plaintiff is not in possession of Danda, Chhatra, Chanwar andSinghasan of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth which, in fact, are in absolute possession of appellant.Plaintiff is not in possession of immoveable or moveable properties of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth.Plaintiff has no right to sue. Plaintiff is a stranger to Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and without anyqualification and relation. He is not competent to initiate any proceeding against appellant in anycapacity whatsoever. Suit is under valued and Court fee paid is insufficient. It is not stated as to howsuit is valued.21. It is further pleaded by appellant in written statement that on the death of BrahmanandSaraswati, an interim Committee of Management was set up with plaintiff as its president. Herecognized Swami Shantanand Saraswati as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeethafter Late Brahmanand Saraswati. Subsequently out of sheer greed, plaintiff turned hostile andfought various legal battles to create hurdles in smooth functioning of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth.This futile suit has been filed to disturb peace and affairs of Math/Peeth. Plaintiff's action isdeliberate with mala fide intention. He has concealed and omitted to mention various litigationsregarding affairs of Math/Peeth in question. Properties belong to Krishnanand Trust, has gotdistinct entity and those properties do not belong to Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth Trust. Management ofsaid property, belong to Krishnanand Trust, is in the hands of Trustee, which office is also with theappellant as Shankaracharya (ex-officio president). Properties and gifts received by LateBrahmanand Saraswati in different capacities, neither, ever blended together nor mis-invested withother Heads against the 'Will' of donor. Office of Shankaracharya is not for preaching religion onlyand that too within the restrictive limits of any particular country or particular region. It is for theentire world as the basic moto and Slogan is "Vishwa ka kalyan ho". If a person praying for welfareof world visits foreign countries, he cannot be disqualified for a coveted office of Shankaracharya.Plaintiff himself has visited Mauritius and other foreign countries in the capacity of Shankaracharya.Appellant never visited any foreign country in the capacity of Shankaracharya and any avermentcontrary to it is false. Appellant is more suitable and competent person to function according totenets, rituals, teachings and also to manage properties and affairs of the Peeth. He is a man ofstrong character and exceptional capability needed for coveted office of Shankaracharya.Educational qualification is not a standard to judge capability of Peethadeshwar. He should becompetent to observe the vitals and tenets of a particular sect for the benefit of Math/Peeth. Forattainment of final Purushartha, knowledge becomes essential and for acquiring knowledge, a puremind is essential, inasmuch as, for purity of mind, performance of rites becomes essential. Thisperformance of rites becomes integral part of teachings of Adi Shankaracharya. Suit is barred bySection 92 C.P.C. as also principles of res judicata and estoppel. Plaint is liable to be rejected underOrder 11 Rule 7 C.P.C. and also barred under Specific Relief Act. Plaint contains various pleas whichare unnecessary, scandalous and frivolous and likely to prejudice, embarrass and delay fair trial ofthe suit. Pleas taken therein amount to abuse of the process of Court, as such liable to be struck offSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/9under Order 6 Rule 16 C.P.C. Plaintiff is not entitled to any relief, hence suit is liable to be dismissedwith exemplary costs.Replication22. Replication dated 19.04.1995, paper no. 66-Ka was also filed by plaintiff. It is stated therein thatplaintiff was installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 07.12.1973 andis performing religious duties, functions, obligations as provided in 'Mathamnaya' and'Mahanushasan', books of command prescribed by Adi Guru Shankaracharya for installation andfunctioning of Shankaracharyas of four Peeths established and founded by him in four corners ofIndia. Plaintiff has full and absolute right to perform such duties having been installed on07.12.1973. He has been recognized as such by rest three Shankaracharyas of Sharda Peeth,Goveradhan Peeth and Shringeri Peeth. Besides, Sanyasis, Pandits, Sadhus, Grahisthas and variousreligious Heads have also recognized and acclaimed plaintiff as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath, Jyotishpeeth, KVP vide its letter dated 12.09.1973, "B.D.M., V.N.S." vide letter dated22.10.1973, Shringeri Peeth vide letter dated 12.11.1974, Dwarika Peeth vide letter dated 07.12.1973.Other religious institutions have also recognized and appreciated installation of plaintiff as JagatGuru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Appellant is neither Jagat Guru Shankaracharyaof said Peeth nor has been installed at any point of time. His claim to have been installed asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth is wholly illegal, baseless and void ab initio. It is not inaccordance with Rules and Regulations laid down by books of command namely 'Mathamnaya' and'Mahanushasan' etc., customs and usage of Peeth. Defendant, 'suffering with leprosy' is unfit to beinstalled as Shankaracharya. He has visited foreign countries, hence also unfit. He was working andserving as teacher on monthly salary, hence could not have become a 'Sanayasi' and installed asShankaracharya. Appellant did not possess requisite qualification for being installed asShankaracharya, as per books of commands, namely 'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan'. Rules andRegulations contained in the aforesaid books of command are mandatory and not recommendatory.It is incorrect that a duly installed Shankaracharya of one Peeth cannot become and installed asShankaracharya of another Peeth. Plaintiff was rightly installed as Shankaracharya of Dwarika Peethby learned Pandits, Sadhus, Sanyasis and religious institutions. Appellant has no right or authorityto challenge the same. There is prohibition that there cannot be two Shankaracharya at one Peeth.23. Plaintiff further said in replication that "B.D.M., V.N.S." has power and right for installation andrecognition of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth to a person who is learned Sanyasi andpossesses requisite qualification laid down in the books of commands i.e. 'Mathamnaya' and'Mahanushasan'. All gifts, donations, offerings etc. made by worshipers, religious persons and otherconcerned to late Brahmanand Saraswati (Former Jagat Guru Sankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth), were in the capacity of such office and not individual, therefore, entireproperty vests in Peeth and not individual property of any one. Ramji alias Shantanand Saraswatiwas not qualified to be installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya nor he was so installed as such. No'Will' was executed by late Brahmanand Saraswati in favour of Ramji Tripathi and others. Alleged'Will' relied by appellant said to be executed by late Brahmanand Saraswati is forged and fictitious.It is a manufactured and manipulated document prepared by interested persons, namely RamjiTripathi and others. Late Brahmanand Saraswati was not in sound disposing mind at the time whenSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/10alleged 'Will' is said to have been executed. He was also not entitled to execute any 'Will' making lineof succession to the office of Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of the Peeth. Such execution of 'Will' isforeign to spirit of Rules and Regulations laid down in books of command, namely, 'Mathamnaya'and 'Mahanushasan'. Plaintiff has right to challenge the aforesaid 'Will' as forged and fictitious. LateSri Krishna Bodhaharamji was chela of late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. He was installed asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth. He performed duties and obligations of said office andassertions contrary thereto in written statement are incorrect. Suit has been filed to protect interestof Peeth and its property from being usurped and possessed by persons having self vested interest.Plaintiff is disciple of late Swami Krishna Bodhaharamji and qualified for the office ofShankaracharya. He was installed as such on 07.12.1973. Sri Ramji Tripathi alias ShankaranandSaraswati was neither installed as Shankaracharya nor entitled to nominate or appoint SwamiVishnu Devanand Saraswati as Shankaracharya and allegations otherwise in the written statementare false and contrary to Rules and Regulations laid down in the books of commands. Swami VishnuDevanand Saraswati was not Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth nor was soinstalled at any point of time. Shantanand Saraswati was also not installed as Shankaracharya,hence question of his relinquishment of office does not arise. He was not entitled to nominate orappoint Swami Vishnu Devanand as Shankaracharya. Vishnu Devanand never held the office ofShankaracharya. Appellant's claim is false, frivolous and baseless. Vishnu Devanand Saraswatiexpired in individual capacity and not as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. He was neverrecognized as Shankaracharya by learned Pandits, Sanyasies etc. Alleged nomination/appointmentof appellant by Vishnu Devanand is false. No 'Will' was executed by Vishnu Devanand in favour ofappellant on 17.04.1989. Vishnu Devanand otherwise had no right to execute any 'Will' in favour ofappellant, appointing or nominating him as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth. Alleged'Will' dated 17.04.1989 is forged and fictitious. Documents, if any, relied by appellant are allmanipulated, inadmissible in evidence and void. Appellant does not possess requisite qualificationsfor installation as Shankaracharya. Appellant is neither duly installed Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth nor holds or entitled to hold Danda, Chhatra, Chawar and Singhasan of theoffice of Shankaracharya and allegations otherwise contained in the written statement are concoctedand false. Suit is neither bad for want of cause of action nor is barred by the principles ofres-judicata or any other legal principle. Plaintiff has never visited any foreign country and theallegations otherwise are incorrect. Appellant has no right and authority to claim himself as dulyinstalled Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth. He has no locus standi to put a false claim tothe said office suffering several disqualifications and suit is liable to be decreed with special costsunder Section 35-A of C.P.C.Amendment Application dated 01.09.200524. A detailed amendment application dated 01.09.2005 (paper No.366-Ka) was filed by plaintiff,seeking addition of several paragraphs, grounds and relief in the plaint. Trial Court vide order dated22.12.2006 rejected substantial proposed amendments and instead allowed it partially.

Pursuant to partial amendment allowed by Court below, an additional written statement dated03.01.2007 was filed stating that appellant was duly and validly installed Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth on 14th and 15th November 1989, after due ceremony at Allahabad andhas come into possession over Danda, Chatra, Chanwar and Singhasan of the office ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/12Shankaracharya of the said Peeth. Appellant is qualified to become Shankaracharya and insteadplaintiff lacks qualification. Plaintiff also does not possess any degree from recognized University orinstitution within the territory of India and abroad. Inclusion of amended cause of action is malafide and not maintainable. Suit as initially instituted has become infructuous after installation ofappellant as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Suit is liable to be stayed under Section 10of C.P.C. in view of earlier Suit No.1-A of 1974 filed by plaintiff and pending in the Court ofAdditional Civil Judge (Senior Division)-1, Room No.13, Allahabad. In earlier suit plaintiff hadsought a declaration that he is Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth with effect from07.12.1973 and has also sought for recovery of certain property of the said Peeth. The said suit is stillpending. Subsequent suit is consequential to declaration sought in earlier suit, hence notmaintainable and liable to be rejected or in any case deserves to be stayed till earlier suit is decided.Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth is a Mourusi Math. Succession to Headship is in accordance withGuru-Shishya Parampara, whereby reigning Mahant chooses his successor from amongst, disciplesof Peeth to become successor Mahant. This is evident from custom prevailing in all four Maths,established by Adi Shankaracharya. It is admitted by plaintiff that only disciples of AdiShankaracharya are given charge of Headship of four Maths, established in four extremities inIndia. There is no other custom prevailing anywhere other than the custom as said above. Onaccount of natural calamity, seat of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth remained extinct for a period of 165years. After due perserverance of learned Sadhus, Sanyasis and with the help of British officials, thesame old seat of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth was resurrected with its original glory, functions andcustoms. It is not establishment of a new Peeth after resurrection. Declaration deed was prepared in1941 in respect of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth only with an intention to lay down procedure forselection of Shankaracharya and confer upon him legal right to hold august seat of Shankaracharya.Guru-Shishya Parampara, stood broken due to extinction of Peeth for a considerable period of timei.e. about 165 years. Declaration of 1941 recognizes Guru-Shishya Parampara for future guidanceand management of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth. Declaration contained stipulation that for anyextraneous reason, in future, if the seat of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth is extinct and customs could notbe adhered, then there may be selection of eligible person as Shankaracharya with approval oflearned Sadhus and Sannaysis. Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth is following strictly Guru-ShishyaParampara for appointment of successor Mahant right from the time of Bramanand Saraswati. Theseat since then has never remained vacant or became extinct. Appellant has been appointed as perthe customs of Math and otherwise claim set up by plaintiff is incorrect. As per customs of MourusiMath, reigning mahant is best judge to decide, who possesses requisite qualification to becomeShankaracharya. Successor of said office is religious and spiritual person and no judicial authority orLaw Courts can investigate into such matters and record findings over qualifications needed forinstallation as Shankaracharya. Qualification of Shankaracharya is not justiciable. Suit as framed isnot maintainable. As per norms of Math, laid down by Adi Shankaracharya, respective Head ofMaths cannot be interfered by Courts and they are beyond jurisdiction of Courts. The managementof Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth is being looked after, smoothly, since 1941, as per customs, and, nootherwise custom can be incorporated or imported by anyone including 'B.D.M., VNS'. Plaintiff is anarch litigant, fighting cases against all Mahants of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth for the last 50 years ormore, for its personal gains and hampering sentiments of people at large in the society. Plaintiffhimself is not qualified to become Shankaracharya in the light of the norms set out by customs.Valuation of the suit is very high, but it has been undervalued.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/13Issues26.

An application was filed for considering this aspect as preliminary issue, but it wasrejected by Additional Civil Judge (Junior Division) on 27.08.1998. Defendant-appellant preferred arevision which was rejected by District Judge on 28.09.1998, holding that order was interlocutory innature hence revision was not maintainable. It also observed that issues are yet to be framed andquestion of jurisdiction after framing of issues would be decided as preliminary issues beforeproceeding with the suit.38. Thereafter on 12.10.1998, issues 1 to 16 were framed. Issues 17 and 18 were framed on30.08.2005 and issues 19 and 20 were framed on 16.05.2007.

Said application was broadly rejected by Trial Court vide order dated22.12.2006. It permitted only a few minor amendments.Previous Litigation:42. Before proceeding to adjudicate points for determination arising in this appeal, we find itappropriate to refer a long chain of litigations followed in respect to Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeethbetween different parties, some of which have substantially been relied by both the sides in supportof one or the other submissions.43. In order to have things straight, it would be appropriate to recapitulate earlier litigation,chronologically, as under:(i) Misc. Case No. 44 of 1953 (under Section 372 of Indian Succession Act, 1925)- Swami SantanandVs. Swami Swaroopanand(ii) Original Suit No. 3 of 1954 - Swami Parmanand and three others Vs. Ramji Tripathi (later knownas Swami Shantanand)(iii) Original Suit No. 47 of 1954 - Ram Lakhan Singh and others Vs. Swami Shantanand Saraswatiand others(iii) Original Suit No. 3 of 1963 - Swami Krishna Bodhashram Vs. Swami Shantanand(iv) Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 -Swami Shantanand Saraswati Vs. Swami Krishna Bodhashram and2 othersSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/24(v) Criminal Misc. Case No. 2 of 2002(66-67), under Section 145 Cr.P.C.(vi) Original Suit No. 1-A of 1974 -Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati Vs. Ramji Tripathi (later know asSwami Shantanand and 2 others)(vii) Criminal Misc. Case No. 1553 of 1969(viii) Suit under Section 229-B of U.P.Z.A. and L.R. Act, 1951 (filed on 28.12.1976).44. For the present case, a brief retrospect of earlier litigations in Misc. Case No. 44 of 1953, OriginalSuit No. 3 of 1954, Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 and Original Suit No. 1A of 1974 would be relevant,hence, in brief, the same are being considered hereunder.Misc. Case No. 44 of 195345. Swami Shantanand filed an application under Section 372 of Indian Succession Act,1925(hereinafter referred to as "Act 1925"), claiming succession certificate in respect of certain moneylying with different Banks at Allahabad, details whereof was given at the foot of application. It wasclaimed that the said property was held by late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati as his property. Theapplication was registered in the Court of District Judge, Allahabad as Misc. Case No. 44 of 1953.Application contained assertions that Swami Brahmanand Saraswati left for heavenly abode on20.05.1953 at Calcutta. He executed a 'Will' on 18.12.1952, appointing Swami Shantanand assuccessor and by virtue of 'Will', applicant Swami Shantanand was entitled to collect money lyingwith different Banks in the name of deceased.46. Application was opposed by Swami Swaroopanand (present plaintiff) by filing objection dated04.08.1953. Objector stated that application for grant of succession certificate filed by SwamiShantanand is unauthorized, against law and not maintainable; 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 was neither agenuine document nor deceased could have executed such 'Will'; Objector is a senior devoteddisciple of deceased; Genuineness and validity of 'Will' not only was denied but it was also pleadedthat it must have been obtained by undue influence of applicant Swami Shantanand; Propertydetails in the application pertains to Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, a public endowment Trust ofreligious and charitable nature; Deceased Swami Brahamanand being Mahant, was in the capacityof Manager of Trust, had no power to dispose of such property and alleged "Will" is inoperative inregard to movable and immovable property of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth; property mentioned in the"Will" was not personal property of deceased, hence he had no competence to execute 'Will' inregard thereto; "Will" relied by applicant is illegal, invalid and unenforceable, hence cannot createany right in favour of applicant; applicant is not a properly initiated disciple of deceased; He is anatural relation of late Brahmanand Saraswati of his Purvashram and had been living with himsince about a year before his death; he is not a Sanyasi and does not possess qualification requiredfor being "Shankaracharya" of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth: Applicant can neither be successor norheir of deceased and application is unauthorized; objector and some other disciples are dulyinitiated Chelas of deceased and objector being a senior Chela and heir of deceased, is entitled to theseat of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth; considering nature of property which is that of Trust, noSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/25application for succession certificate is maintainable; application is barred by Section 370 of Act1925 and applicant is not entitled to certificate unless he establishes his claim in a competent Courtof law or gets probate of alleged 'Will'; Applicant should have mentioned about disciples of lateBrahmanand Saraswati so that notices could have been issued to such disciples and personsinterested in Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth; Applicant has acted illegally by intentionally omitting namesof such disciples; Applicant was not an elected Mahant of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and no Abhishekor installation ceremony, as required by custom and usage of Math was ever performed in his caseand claim made by him is false; Late Brahmanand Saraswati did not leave any estate since he wasnot owner of property in suit or other properties, hence no succession certificate can be granted.47. District Judge formulated following three issues:-"1. Whether the document dated 18th December, 1952 is the last 'Will' by Swami Brahmanand? Wasit duly executed and attested?2. Was the will obtained by undue influence of the applicant?3. Was the testator competent to dispose of the property in dispute by a 'Will'?"(emphasis added)48. Issue-3 was subsequently struck off by District Judge, observing that in summary proceedings itwas neither necessary nor expedient to decide dispute of title and this issue should be left fordetermination in regular suit. He also observed that only issue required to be considered is, whether'Will' was duly executed by late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati; it is a genuine document andrepresents his last will, for the reason that, if it is established to be a genuine 'Will', it would meanthat the Testator looked upon applicant as a proper person to collect debt due to Testator and on thebasis of said 'Will', applicant should be allowed to collect debts due to deceased. Hence, applicantwas required only to establish genuineness of 'Will'. The matter was subsequently transferred to theCourt of Civil Judge, Allahabad.49. Issues 1 and 2 relating to 'Will' were decided together vide judgment dated 12.12.1955. Courtheld that late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati when signed the document was in perfect senses,capable of understanding what he was doing. In this regard, Court relied on the statement of Dr.Krishan Saran Mathur, Reader in Medicine, Medical College, Agra, who deposed before Court andsaid that he examined late Brahmanand on 21.12.1952 at Agra, i.e. just three days after execution of"Will" and found everything normal about his memory, intelligence etc. Medical problem he had,was about breathlessness, loss of appetite and constipation etc., which had nothing to do withmental condition. Another evidence relied by Court below was statement of Dr. Raj Kishore, whoclaims to have examined late Swami Brahmanand on 22.11.1952 at Delhi and after 3-4 weeks at Agraalso. Third statement was of Dr. Dubey, Lecturer in Medical College, Agra and a Physician in SarojniNaidau Hospital, Agra. In absence of any otherwise evidence led by Objector, Court believedstatements of medical experts. Objector examined one Swami Bhagwatanand who stated that he hadno knowledge whether any "Will" was executed or not. Another witness Swami Govindanand statedSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/26that he did not hear about execution of 'Will' from Testator, but after execution, Testator told himthat a 'Will' was got executed under pressure when he was ill. Both these witnesses were examinedon Commission at Varanasi. Court also relied on the statements of attesting witnesses i.e.Rameshwar Prasad Tiwari and Shyam Narain Gupta and also the author Sri Krishna GopalChaudhary, Advocate, to establish that 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 was duly executed by SwamiBrahmanand, after understanding its implications, and, he was in sound mental condition at thattime, he was a capable Testator and, therefore, document was accepted as genuine. No evidence wasadduced to show that 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 was not the last 'Will', hence it was taken as the last'Will' of Testator. The objection with regard to "undue influence" could not be proved. Court alsoobserved that after death of Swami Brahmanand, an interim committee was formed formanagement of property and affairs of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Bal Krishna Mishra was theSecretary of Committee, who deposed as PW-3. He also said that "Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati"was President of the said Committee and Govindanand, a witness examined by Swami Swroopanandwas one of the members of Committee. Proceedings dated 22.05.1953 show that Interim Committeeunder Presidentship of Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati passed a resolution that last "Will" of lateSwami Brahmanand should be taken out and be obtained from the Court of District Judge.Proceedings dated 07.06.1953 show that a certified copy of 'Will' was obtained from Allahabad andproduced before Committee. 'Will' was read over to Committee and it was resolved that it should bepublished in Pandit Sabha and arrangement should be made for installation of successor. Thismeeting was presided by Swami Swroopanand. Thus it is evident that Swami Swroopanand andother disciples of Swami Brahmanand knew well about "Will" executed by Swami Brahmanandwhich was kept at Allahabad and a copy whereof was brought from Allahabad and contents thereofwere made known to all of them. There is nothing on record to show that any of the Objectors evertook any exception to the "Will" or raised any objection that it was not executed by late SwamiBrahmanand and is not a genuine document. Subsequent objection is nothing but an afterthought.Court ultimately accepted "Will" dated 18.12.1952 having been executed by late Swami Brahmanandand duly attested.

Mahesh Brahmchari was In-charge of Publicity Department of SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati and he was editor also of the magazine. Ramji Tripathi (Swami Shantanand)was originally resident of District Basti. He lived with Uria Baba, a Mahatma of high repute atVrindavan from 1945-1949. Later on he came to live for 1Â½ months with Swami BrahmanandSaraswati at Allahabad in 1951. He was initiated by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati as his "DandiSanyasi Chela" in 1951 itself. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, while travelling, reached Delhi on13.11.1952 and stayed there for some time in Queen's Garden near railway station. Later on, heshifted to residence of Sri Bipin Bihari Verma, Bar at Law and Member of Parliament, residing at 7,Canning Lane, New Delhi towards the end of November, 1952. Thereafter he stayed at Agra till24.01.1953. He then went to Varanasi. When he was staying at Agra, a "Will" was allegedly executedas last "Will" on 18.12.1952. It was deposited with District Registrar, Allahabad by Sri DwarikaPrasad Shastri, as holder of power of attorney of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati.

On 22.05.1953 a meeting of disciples of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, presided bySwami Hariharanand (popularly known as Swami Karpatri Ji) was held at Varanasi. An interimCommittee of disciples of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was formed to manage Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth till his last "Will" is obtained from District Judge, Allahabad and executed. The interimCommittee consisted of 12 persons whereof Swami Swaroopanand was President and Pandit BalKrishna Misra was Secretary. It also included as members, Pandit Dwarka Prasad Shastri, RamPrasad, Mahesh, Ganga Prasad Pandey etc. On the same day, interim Committee underPresidentship of Swami Swroopanand held meeting and decided to receive "Will". It authorizedGanga Prasad Pandey to obtain "Will" from District Judge, Allahabad with the help of RameshwarPrasad Tiwari and produce it before Committee. On 25.05.1953, "Will" dated 18.12.1952 was openedbefore District Registrar, Allahabad, after he got satisfied about the death of Swami BrahmanandSaraswati. Ganga Prasad Pandey obtained a certified copy of "Will" and produced the same beforecommittee on 07.06.1953. Committee unanimously decided that "Will" should be published andsuccessor should be installed at the earliest. Another meeting of Committee was held on 08.06.1953,after publication of 'Will', and according to that Sri Ram Ji Tripathi (Swami Shantanand Saraswati)was to be installed as Peethadhishwar of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Installation was to be observedon 12.06.1953 according to Muhurt at Kashi. On 11.06.1953, one Banwari Lal Dixit, moved anapplication under Section 145 Cr.P.C., which was disposed of by City Magistrate on 15.06.1953. Inthe said application Banwari Lal Dixit stated that Sri Shantanand Saraswati was to succeed havingbeen nominated by Swami Brahmanand Sarasawati as successor, but it was opposed by PanditVidwat Mandal (Kashi Vidwat Parishad) and some other religious bodies and personalities. EvenPresident of interim Committee, Swami Swaroopanand was against installation of SwamiShantanand and wanted that Sri Krishnabodhashram to be installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Sri Banwari Lal Dixit requested Magistrate to stop installation of SwamiShantanand, but Magistrate refused to grant any injunction, observing that dispute has to beadjudicated by Civil Court and also observed that installation ceremony must have already takenplace since it was scheduled for 12.06.1953. One Suit No. 374 of 1953 was filed by Bal BrahmchariMahesh Ji and Swami Vishwadevanand Saraswati against Swami Karpatri Ji, Swami KrishnaBodhashram and few others in the Court of Munsif (North), Lucknow, seeking permanentSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/29injunction. An application for temporary injunction was also filed seeking to restrain defendants inthat case from holding a meeting on 24.07.1953 and giving reception as Shankaracharya and takingout procession and proclamation of Swami Krishnabodhashram. Interim injunction was initiallygranted but finally application was rejected on 01.10.1953.53. In the meantime, on 11.07.1953 Swami Shantanand filed application for succession certificate,wherein Swami Swroopanand filed objection, which was registered as Misc. Case No. 44 of 1953.54. Plaintiff Swami Parmanand Saraswati, and three others pleaded that Swami Shantanand lackedrequisite qualification of Shankaracharya as per norms laid down by Jagat Guru AdiShankaracharya in his books Mathamanaya and Mahanushasan. It is said that after death of SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati, question arose about installation of his successor. Learned Pandits,Mahants, Brahmcharis, Sanyasis and disciples etc. initially selected a Dandi Swami Hariharan(Karpatri Ji Maharaj) but when he declined, Dandi Swami Sri Krishnabodhashram was selected andinstalled on 25.06.1953 at Gyanvapi, near Krishna temple, Varanasi. Installation ceremony wasgraced by Jagat Guru Shankaracharya Swami Abhinav Sachchidanand Teerth Maharaj of ShardaPeeth at Dwarka and attended by all persons, sections of Hindu religious institutions and Headsgiving him their recognition by offering respect and gifts etc. on the occasion. Since installation,Swami Krishnabodhashram Ji Maharaj became Shankaracharya and is recognized by all concerned.A similar installation ceremony later on was performed at Jyotishpeeth Badrikashram. SwamiKrishnabodhashram is in possession of Peeth properties. Defendant Ramji Tripathi (SwamiShantanand) having learnt that Krishnabodhashram has been installed as Shankaracharyaproclaimed himself to be Shankaracharya and successor of deceased Swami Brahmanand Saraswati,despite that he did not possess qualifications prescribed in Mathamnyya to become Shankaracharya.He obtained a 'Will' under undue influence, executed by late Swami Mahant Brahmanand Saraswati,and on the basis thereof, took possession of some movable and immovable properties ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and has committed breach of trust by misappropriating a large amount ofproperty in various ways.55. It was in this background that Suit 3 of 1954 under Section 92 CPC was filed, seeking relief notedabove.56. Suit was contested by sole defendant Ram Ji Tripathi (Swami Shantanand). He pleaded thatplaintiff has no cause of action and defendant having already been installed validly is successor oflate Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, pursuant to 'Will' executed by him and installed asShankaracharya; allegations of misappropriation are false; and suit was liable to be rejected.57. Court formulated following 16 issues as under:-"1. Whether the plaintiffs have got any cause of action against the defendants?2.

He made these Maths centres of Vedantic teachings. Each Math was placed in the charge ofone of his four principal disciples who were Padmapada, Hasthmalak, Sureshwar and Trotraka whowere appointed as Mahants of these Maths. These Mahants were entitled to nominate one of hisdisciples to be Mahant after his death. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was Mahant of Jyotirmath atBadrinath. He nominated plaintiff, one of his principal disciples, to be Shankaracharya and Mahantof Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, after his death. He disclosed his wishes in 'Will' executed by him.Swami Brahmanand Saraswati died on 20.5.1953.

He also filed appeal in High Courtagainst grant of succession certificate to plaintiff but the same was dismissed. In fact, SwamiKarpatri Ji alias Swami Hariharanand Saraswati has set up different claimants against plaintiff andcaused various suits filed in different Courts. Suit 3 of 1954 was filed under Section 92 CPC forremoval of plaintiff from the office of Mahant of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth as well as for rendition ofaccounts but it was dismissed by Additional District Judge, Varanasi vide judgment and decreedated 20.10.1962.

Before Kumbh Mela Haridwar,Ram Lakhan Singh and others filed Suit 47 of 1954 against plaintiff in the Court of Munsif South,Lucknow, seeking injunction and restraining plaintiff from proclaiming himself as Jagat GuruShankaracharya and using articles of decoration. An application under Order 39 Rule 2 CPC foralleged disobedience of injunction order dated 31.01.1954 was filed but the same was dismissed byCourt on 10.2.1962. Plaintiff is holding office of Shankaracharya and is entitled to use decorationarticles like Danda, Chhatra, Chanwar, Singhasan etc. A section of Hindus decided to observeKumbh in February, 1965. Plaintiff was also of the opinion that Kumbh be observed in 1965 and notin 1966. Taking advantage of ensuing Kumbh, defendants started to proclaim that defendant-1 isJyotish Peethadhishwar, i.e., Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth andpamphlets were distributed at Allahabad and other places. Defendants also arranged to take out aprocession on 13th as troll as on subsequent days in Magh Mela Area, proclaiming defendant-1 to beJyotish Peethadhishwar as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya, of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Defendant-1 isneither entitled to proclaim himself as Peethadhishwar of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth nor entitled touse Chhatra, Chanwar etc. Plaintiff is entitled to get defendants restrained from proclaimingdefendant-1 as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, hence the suit.66. Suit was contested by Swami Krishnabodhashram and other defendants by filing their combinedwritten statement dated August 1965, though written statement was signed by defendant-2 onbehalf of all defendants. He denied that Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was Mahant ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/34Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth for the reason that Peeth does not have any Mahant. Swami BrahmanandSaraswati was Aacharya and Head of Math. Death of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati on 20.05.1955was admitted but other averments were denied. It was pleaded that defendant-1 rightly wasproclaimed by public as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and contraryaverments were denied. In additional pleas, defendants pleaded that Swami Brahmanand Saraswatidid not nominate or constitute plaintiff as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, no 'Will' wasexecuted in favour of plaintiff; Plaintiff was never installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth; Swami Brahmanand Saraswati had no right to nominate his successor;even if he had a right, plaintiff was not such a person who fulfilled requirements of Shankaracharyaas laid down in the verses of Mathamnaya and Mahanushasan which were prescribed by Adi JagatGuru Shankaracharya and contains Rules and Regulations governing four Maths established by him,i.e., Jyotirmath near Badrinath in Pauri Garhwal in North; Sharda Math in Gujarat; Sringeri Math inSouth India and Goverdhan Math at Puri. In Suit-3 of 1954, Court recorded findings against plaintiffthat he did not possess some of necessary qualifications of Shankaracharya of Jyotirpeeth and hisappointment to said office was invalid. However, suit was dismissed on technical ground thatdefendant-1 was not made party. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was suffering from sleeplessnessand other ailments from long time and did not enjoy sound disposing mind and was not in a fit stateof mind or body to execute alleged 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 under which plaintiff is claiming his rightto be successor in the office and Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. 'Will' dated 18.12.1952was never executed by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. It was not signed at all by him, who was notin a sound disposing mind nor in a fit mental and physical condition to execute it. He was too feebleand ill and was not capable to understand contents of 'Will' and the 'Will' does not represent hismind. The 'Will' was brought about by undue influence and importunity of plaintiff, who was arelation of late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati and might have exercised that influence himself aswell as through one Mahesh Brahmchari, who was Private Secretary and a man of great confidenceof late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. 'Will' was a forged document and has no legal effect. On thedeath of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, a question arose about appointment of successor of JagatGuru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Learned Pandits, Mahants, Mandelshwars,Sanyasis and most of disciples of late Jagat Guru Shankaracharya Swami Brahmanand Saraswatiselected and duly installed defendant-1, who had been a Sanyasi for the last about 40 years, as JagatGuru Shankaracharya of Jyotirpeeth, on 25.06.1963 with all religious ceremonies at Gyanvapi nearfamous temple of Vishwanathji of Varanasi. Shankaracharya Swami Abhinav Sachchidanand Tirthof Sharda Peeth at Dwarika attended the said installation of defendant-1 and since then he isfunctioning as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and is being recognized as such. Afterinstlallation at Varanasi, defendant-1 went to Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth and there he was againinstalled to Peeth. He began to live there and got under his possession the properties ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Plaintiff was not duly installed as Shankaracharya on 12.06.1953 asclaimed by him. No installation ceremony ever took place. Plaintiff even otherwise did not possessqualification for the said office. No religious ceremony was ever performed for installation ofplaintiff. Original Suit 3 of 1954 was dismissed by District Judge, Varanasi whereagainst FirstAppeal No. 365 of 1962 was filed and during pendency of the said appeal, succession certificategranted, stood in the name of Registrar, High Court, Allahabad, under orders of Court. Plaintiffcould not have withdrawn any money except with permission of Court. Plaintiff also filed arepresentative suit 9 of 1954 in the Court of Civil Judge, Allahabad through Swami Magnanand andSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/35others by impleading Swami Krishna Bodhashram as defendant, seeking injunction restrainingdefendants from setting himself as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Said suit wasdismissed with costs in the absence of plaintiffs. Another suit was filed by Sri Mahesh Ji at theinstance of plaintiff, a close associate, being Original Suit No. 374 of 1953 in the Court of MunsifNorth, Lucknow for obtaining an ad interim injunction against Swami Krishna Bodhashram andalso from holding any meeting on 24.7.1953 so as to give a reception to Swami Krishna Bodhashramas Shankaracharya and taking procession. Plaintiff Sri Mahesh failed to get interim injunction andultimately Original Suit 374 of 1953 was also dismissed. Defendant-1, since his installation asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 25.6.1953, has been occupying office and hasperfected his title and right by way of adverse possession. Moreover, defendant-1 is recognized byall, hence plaintiff is not entitled to challenge the just claim of defendant-1. Defendants 2 and 3 alsorecognized defendant-1 as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Allegation of setting uppersons to file various cases is denied. In Suit-47 of 1954 filed by Ram Lakhan against plaintiff, aninjunction order was passed on 30.1.1954 restraining plaintiff from proclaiming himself as JagatGuru Shankaracharya and using articles of decoration etc. Said injunction continued till 16.8.1962.Advice and opinion for observing Kumbh in 1965 was actually tendered by defendant-1 asShankaracharya of Jyotishpeeth, Dwarika, Shankaracharya of Govardhan Peeth at Puri andShankaracharya of Sringeri Peeth of Mysore as well as other learned Pandits. Plaintiff has possessedsome property of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth wrongfully and making wrongful gain therefrom. Suit isbarred under Section 10 CPC and even otherwise it has rendered infructuous.67.

Whether the defendants are entitled to special Costs?8. To what relief if any is the plaintiff entitled."(emphasis added)68. Court of Vth Temporary Civil and Sessions Judge, Allahabad presided by Sri B.P. Shukla decidedOriginal Suit No. 36 of 1965 by a detailed judgment dated 15.1.1970.69. Issues-1 and 2 were taken together by Court. It traced history of institution of Math as describedin Sammantha Pandara v. Sellappa Chetti I.L.R, 2 Mad. 175. Adi Shankaracharya established fourMaths, which are as under :Sl.No.Name of Maths Details1. Poorvamanyaya :Puri Jagannath Math Established at Puri Jagannath covering the areas of Anga, Vanga Kalinga,Magadha, Utkala and Barabara States.2. Paschimanyaya:Dwarka Math Established at Dwarka covering areas of Sindhu, Sourashti, Souveera andMaharashtra.3. Uttaramanyaya :Jyotir Math Established at Badrinath covering the areas of Kuru, Kashmir, Khabmoja and PanchalaStates.4. Dakshinamanya :Sringeri Math Established at Sringeri covering the areas of Karnataka Kerala.70. Sri Trotokacharya was the first Shankaracharya appointed by Adi Jagat Guru Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. In all, forty Acharyas had occupied this Peeth, first being Acharya Trotakand last Sri Ram Krishna Teerth Swami, who left this universe in Vikram Samvat 1853 (1796 AD).Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth seat remained unoccupied for about 165 years. Thereafter, B.D.M., VNSwith support of large section of Hindus, selected and installed Swami Brahmanand Saraswati asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. A declaration of trust dated 11.05.1941 was also writtendown. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati died on 20.05.1953 at Calcutta. After his death a seriousdispute regarding succession cropped up, causing several litigation in Courts. Shantanand SaraswatiSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/37claimed office on the strength of Will dated 18.12.1952. Defendant Krishna Bodhashram and othersdisputed it on the ground that Brahmanand Saraswati had no power to nominate his successor.71. Court after examining earlier litigation and other record as well as evidence, ultimately held thatShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth had a right to nominate his successor and otherwisecontention advanced by defendant was not correct. In recording aforesaid findings, Court relied onstatement of DW-2, Sri Abhinav Sachidanand Tirth Ji, Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Dwarka Peeth,Sharda, who said that it is always better if Shankaracharya himself installs or nominates his disciplein the office and this power of nomination, Shankaracharya possesses. It recorded finding as under :"Thus there is no escape from the conclusion that reigning Shankaracharya as a superior of thepeetha has got a right to nominate his disciple as a successor."(emphasis added)72. Then Court examined genuineness of 'Will' in respect whereto scribe Sri Krishna GopalChowdhary, Advocate of Etawah was examined as PW-17. Attesting witness PW-13 Shyam NarainGupta and PW-6 Rameshwar Prasad Tiwari were also examined. Court ultimately recorded findingsby observing:"Looking to the overall picture of evidence presented by respectable witness, Sri Krishna GopalChowdhary, Sri Shyam Narain Gupta and Sri Rameshwar Prasad Tiwari, I am prepared to take areasonable view of holding that the Will was duly executed by Sri Brahmanand Saraswati afterunderstanding the contents thereof........ In the result, I hold that the plaintiff has proved the factthat the testator was a sound and disposing state of mind, the testator signed the will lying indeposit with the District Registrar, Allahabad, a copy of which is Paper No.71 C, Ex.-152. I furtherhold that Will was exeuted by the free will of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. It is further my findingthat particular of undue influence etc., as alleged in paras 31 to 33 of the written statement have notbeen made out. Accordingly, in the light of the Will dated 18.12.1952, it has to be held that late SriBrahmanand Saraswati had nominated and constituted the plaintiff as Jyotish Peetha as alleged byplaintiff."(emphasis added)73. Consequently, Court answered issues 1 and 2 both in favour of plaintiff and against defendants.74. Then issue 3 was taken and it was also decided in favour of plaintiff. Court held:"In view of the overwhelming oral and documentary evidence discussed above, in my opinion, it hasbeen proved to the hilt that according to the directions in the will and the traditions of the mutt, theinstallation ceremony of the plaintiff took place on 12.6.53 at Brahma Nivas Varanasi. The issue isdecided accordingly in favour of the plaintiff." (emphasis added)Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/3875. Issue-4 pertained to requisite qualifications of Shankaracharya, whether possessed by plaintiff ornot. Learned Judge observed that directions of Adi Shankaracharya represented ideal qualificationsof successor of Shankaracharya. In his view, these directions are recommendatory and can not besaid to be mandatory. For this purpose, he relied on observations of B.K.Mukherjee in his "Law ofEndowment" at page 302 that the standards has much deteriorated in modern times, highphilosophic knowledge or spirituality is seldom to be met with institutions, stress is now primarilylaid on the observations of the rites and tenets of particular sect for the use of benefit of which theMutt is established. Court held that due performance of rites is an integral part of teachings of AdiShankaracharya and referred to certain verses on the authority of Guru. Court also held thatdecision of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati regarding plaintiff being successor of Peeth has to beupheld. In this regard, Trial Court also relied on the judgment of Patna High Court in MahantGirjanand Bhagat Vs. Bhagwan Bhagat and others AIR 1967 (Patna) 101. It says that scope of reviewin religious matters is limited. It said:"Therefore, the Court could only see if the plaintiff was Sanyasi, Brahmin and disciple of lateJagatguru Shankaracharya and if he has been nominated as a successor by his Guru, the Courtshould uphold that appointment, in other words, judgment of the Guru by nominating the disciple ispositive proof of the capability of his disciple, hence merely on the strength of the nomination by theGuru the finding of capability has to be imparted in favour of the plaintiff disciple."(emphasis added)76. After examining evidence on record, Court said:"It would thus appear that on the plaintiffs side there is the nomination in the will by Guru. Thatway his Guru found him as a proper disciple, the nomination implied that the late Jagatgurudetermined his qualifications and found him as Sat Shishya. Adding that circumstance as anadditional weight in the scale of evidence for the plaintiff, I am inclined to believe P.W.4 Pandit RamKhelawan Tripathi, P.W.7 Dr. Jai Ram Mishra, P.W.9 Sri Makhan Lal Kela, P.W.10 Sri Satya NandGaur, P.W.11 Brahmachari Shanker Lal, P.W.14 Sri ram Narain Dutt Pande, P.W.15 Sri KapildeoTripathi and P.W.16 Sri Anantanand Saraswati and hold that the plaintiff has the qualificationsrequired for the office of the Shankaracharya. It is noteworthy that D.W.1, Shankaracharya ofGovardhan Peeth himself has admitted in cross-examination as under:-^^'kadjkpk;Z dks ;g vf/kdkj gS fd og viuk mRrjkf/kdkjh eBkEuk; vkSj egkuq'kklu esa fufnZ"V;ksX;rk okys O;fDr dks gh pkgs tgkWa ls pqusA mudks ;ksX; ns[kus dk vf/kdkjh gSA** Thus, theresponsibility of selection by the competent Guru will be deemed to have been performed in acorrect manner and it should be held that a competent Guru in all probability has nominated acompetent Chela as his successor. The principle that a Mahant will be assumed to be a properperson to judge who is best qualified to succeed him is not open to doubt."(emphasis added)Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/3977. Answering issue-4 in favour of plaintiff Swami Shantanand Saraswati, ultimate conclusionrecorded by Court reads as under :"In view of the above discussion my finding is that in view of the nomination as successor in the willof Swami Brhmanand Ji the late Jagadguru Shankaracharya the plaintiff does possess thequalification for holding the office of Shankaracharya as laid down in Muttamnay andMahanushasan. More over as a secular judge I have no right to interfere with the conscience of thetestator who nominated what he believed to be proper for administration of mutt in future, nor canthe Court sit in judgment on nomination." (emphasis added)78. Thereafter, Court proceeded to decide issue-5 relating to installation of Swami KrishnaBodhashram as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. It held that though ceremony wasperformed on 25.06.1953 for installation of Krishna Bodhashram as Shankaracharya but it did notconfer any legal title upon him for the reason that the then Shankaracharya Swami ShantanandSaraswati was already installed on 12.06.1953 on the strength of 'Will' of Swami BrahmanandSaraswati and when office was already filled up, ceremony of 25.06.1953 can not be foundation foracquisition of title of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth by Krishna Bodhashram. Further,since plaintiff was already in possession of the office in the capacity of Shankaracharya, there was noroom for defendant Swami Krishna Bodhashram for characterizing as 'Shankaracharya' by adversepossession as pleaded in written statement. It also observed that Pandit Sabha could not sit inappeal over the judgment of respondent Brahmanand Saraswati about nomination of his discipleShantanand Saraswati as successor nominee no.1. It pointed out that fluctuating body of PanditSabha consisting of a few persons can not be considered to be a legal authority to determine thequestion and upset decision of late Jagatguru. Mathamnaya is silent on the point, who is to selectSuccessor. Taking clue from the judgment in suit 3 of 1954, Court said, if the line of disciple isextinct, Mahamandal has a right to nominate. Once a Guru has found Adhikari/Uttaradhikari, iffluctuating body of Pandits of various places in India possess authority to select another person oftheir choice, it will create a chaos in utter disregard to the wishes of previous occupant. A personvalidly appointed has a right to continue till actually removed. General public has power to elect aperson only when the line of disciple was extinct and only then they could appoint a highly qualifiedperson according to books of commands. No evidence could be led that entire line of disciple of lateSwami Brahmanand Saraswati had extinct. A non-disciple like Swami Krishna Bodhashram couldnot have been appointed as Shankaracharya in preference to a disciple. It, therefore, answeredissue-5 against defendant-1 holding that claim of Swami Krishna Bodhashram to the office ofShankaracharya by way of adverse possession is unsustainable.79. Issue-6 was already considered as preliminary issue and answered against defendant.80. Thereafter, issues-7 and 8 were taken together and it was held that plaintiff had right toadminister endowment being Head of common spiritual organization, formerly headed by his GuruSwami Brahmanand Saraswati. It also held that unless line of disciples is extinct, Swami KrishnaBodhashram could not claim the said office. It accordingly, decreed the suit and passed followingorder :Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/40"The suit is decreed as prayed. The defendants are restrained from proclaiming the defendant No.1as Shankaracharya and Peethadhishwar of the defendant No.1 from taking the Chhatra, Chamar,Dand and Singhasan as Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peetha and to take out any procession as suchduring the Magh Mela in Allahabad. Costs easy." (emphasis added)81. Defendants brought the matter in appeal being Civil Appeal No.59 of 1970 in the Court ofDistrict Judge, Allahabad. During pendency of appeal, Swami Krishna Bodhashram (defendantappellant no.1) died on 10.09.1973 and there was no substitution. Plaintiff respondent, SwamiShantanand Sawaswati, moved an application that appeal has abated and referred to Order 22 Rule1 C.P.C. This application, was contested by remaining appellants. Therefore, a detailed order dated29.08.1982 was passed by District Judge, Allahabad, deciding that appeal abated as a whole andhence, let it be consigned to record. The order passed by District Judge, Allahabad run in 21paragraphs. It has observed that dispute was between plaintiff and defendant-1 who was alsoclaiming actual right of having been installed in the office of Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 25.06.1953 and has died. Therefore, other defendants have no right tosue and right to appeal also does not survive, hence appeal must abate as a whole. Regarding nonsubstitution, remaining defendant-appellants 2 and 3 contended that office of Mahant is electiveand as such Mahant who would succeed from Swami Krishna Bodhashram cannot be said to be alegal representative, hence there is no question of substitution. District Judge held that thisargument supports the inference that on the death of Swami Krishna Bodhashram Saraswati, rightto sue did not survive and subsequent Mahants or anyone else also cannot claim substitution on hisbehalf. Surviving appellants namely, Karpatriji alias Swami Hariharanand as also Sant SaranVaidanti cannot continue appeal for they had no cause of action left for them to continue appeal.The only averment against them in the plaint was that they also proclaimed Swami KrishnaBodhashram to be Mahant of the Math. Therefore, after death of Swami Krishna Bodhashramquestion of surviving appellants declaring them to be Mahant of the said Math and supporting theirclaim does not arise. It held in para 18 to 21 of the judgment as under:"18. The appellate Court has no power to proceed with the appeal and to reverse and vary the decreein favour of all the plaintiffs or defendants under Order XLI Rule 4 C.P.C. when the decree proceedson a ground common to all the plaintiffs or defendants, if all the plaintiffs or the defendants appealfrom the decree and any of them dies and the appeal abates so far as he is concerned under OrderXXII Rule 3 C.P.C.19. The aforesaid view has been confirmed in a later decision of the Supreme Court, reported in 'SriChand & others v. M/s Jagdish Parshad Kishan Chand & others' (A.I.R. 1966 Supreme Court 1427.)20. The instant appeal where no legal representative of deceased-appellant no.1 has been brought onrecord has otherwise also abated as a whole.21. The counsel for the appellants relied on 'Lal Chand (dead) by L.Rs. & others v. Radha Kishan'(A.I.R. 1977 Supreme Court p. 789) 'State of U.P. v. Smt. Ram Sri & another' (A.I.R. 1976 Allahabadp. 121), and 'Shripad Balvant Kasture & others v. Nagu Kushaba Kate' (A.I.R.

These decisions are, however distinguishable and do not apply to the presentcase." (emphasis added) Civil Suit- 1A of 197482. This suit was filed by Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati vide plaint dated 28.06.1974 in the Courtof District Judge, Seoni (M.P.) for declaration that plaintiff Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati is dulyinstalled Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth; for directing defendant-1 Sri Ramji Tripathi(subsequently known as Swami Shantanand Saraswati) to deliver possession of property mentionedin Schedule 'A' of the plaint to him, and also a declaration that plaintiff possesses propertiesmentioned in Scheduled 'B' attached to the plaint. A permanent injunction was also prayed forrestraining defendants from interfering with plaintiff's management of property of Peeth and indischarge of functions as Shankaracharya.83. There were three persons impleaded as defendants in the aforesaid suit i.e. Ramji Tripathi(Swami Shantanand Saraswati), Dwarika Prasad Shastri and Swami Vishnu Devanand Saraswati,(Chela of late Shankaracharya Swami Brahmanand Saraswati).84. Plaint case set up therein is that several centuries ago, late Jagat Guru Adi Shankaracharyapropounded theory of absolute Monism based on the authority of Upanishads. His philosophysucceeded in combating Budhism and re-establishing religion of Vedas. For the purpose ofstrengthening doctrine of Non-dualistic philosophy, which he preached, four Mathas asmonasteries, in the four extremities of India were established by him i.e. Jyotirmath near Badrinathin Paurigarhwal (now Chamoli Garhwal) in north, Shardamath in the west in Gujrat, Shringeri Mathin the South in Mysore and Gowardhan Math in the East at Puri. He placed each one of them underthe charge his principal ascetic disciples. He also prescribed Rules and Regulations governingaforesaid four Mathas in booklets named 'Mathamnaya' and 'Mahanushasan' written by him. Thetwo books written by Adi Shankaracharya contain details of territorial jurisdiction of Mathas,qualifications for appointment and also for dethroning Head of the Mathas, who was to be known asShankaracharya of the Peeth. The primary object of establishing these Mathas was encouragementand fastening of Vedic teachings by the maintenance of a competent line of teachers impartingreligious instructions to the disciples and others and trying to strengthen doctrines of VedicTeachings so as to prevent any future precipitating of Vedic Religion being affected by philosophiesforeign to it. Besides the contents of two books prescribing qualification etc., for appointment asShankaracharya of Peethas, there are long established customs and traditions in all the four Peethasto install only highly learned Sanyasis possessed of all the qualities laid down in "Mathamnaya" and"Mahanushasan", which have been followed and observed without the least of deviations. InJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth also as per Rules and Regulations prescribed in Mathamnaya, forty onelearned and competent Sanyasis having necessary qualifications laid down in the aforesaid books,were installed as Peethadhishwar of the Peeth, one after another, and they all discharged theirduties and responsibilities and managed affairs of Peeth and its properties. For about 165 yearsJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth remained without a Head. In 1941 three Shankaracharyas of Shringeri,Sharda and Goverdhan Mathas, Rulers of various States, learned people, Sanyasis etc. with an objectto restore Peeth to its pristine estate and prestige, authorized a registered institution known asB.D.M., VNS to search a Sanyasi who satisfies qualifications prescribed by "Mathamnaya" and"Mahanushasan" for being installed a Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeths. SwamiSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/42Brahmanand Saraswati, a great Sanyasi, was selected as Head of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth byB.D.M., VNS and was also approved by Sanyasis including three Shankaracharyas and followers ofVedic teachings. He was duly installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and assumedoffice accordingly. A deed of declaration of Trust was prepared by B.D.M., VNS on Baisakh Sudi 15,Samvat 1998 (11.05.1941) and made over all the land and sites of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, whichwas acquired together with land and Ashram at Varanasi, to Swami Brahmanand Saraswati as JagatGuru Shankaracharya, in Trust, under conditions given in the deed for the benefit ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Thus entire property became property of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth held bySwami Brahmanand Saraswati in Trust for fulfilment of the aims, objects and ideals of Trust. Inaddition to property of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, contributions and donations made by devoteeswere also held by Trust for the same purpose. None of these properties was personal or could betreated to be property of Shankaracharya. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, discharged duties andmanaged affairs of Peeth with great ability with the result that Peeth greatly expanded influenceover people residing in Northern India, who made generous donations of movable and immoveableproperties, so that there may not be any difficulty, financial or otherwise, to the Peeth and Sanyasisattending Peeth in discharge of obligations and fulfilling the purpose for which Adi Shankaracharyahad established the Peeth. These donations were in fact made to Peeth which could be used byPeethadhishwar for fulfilment of aims and objects of Peeth only. Particulars of property acquired forthe Peeth as far as known to the plaintiff is given in Schedule 'A' Parts (i), (ii) and (iii). A Sanyasiwho renounces the world and devotes himself to religion is not permitted to hold property inpersonal capacity except his clothes, Kharauns (wooden slipper) and the like. Hence whatever wasreceived by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati as Shankaracharya of Peeth, was property of Peeth andSwami Brahmanand Saraswati was only managing it as a Trustee. When "Mathamnaya" was writtenfor managing affairs of the Peeth, 'Trust' as understood under English Law, was unknown to ancientHindu religious world and Adi Shankaracharya also did not orient principles of Trust in"Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan". On 20.05.1953, Swami Brahmanand Saraswati breathed hislast. A dispute arose about the appointment of successor. Defendant-1 Sri Ramji Tripathi ( SwamiShantanand Saraswati) claimed right of Headship of the Peeth on the basis of a 'Will' dated18.12.1952 alleged to have been executed by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati in his favour. He was aclose relative of late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati and lived with him for a number of years. Hehad an eye over the seat of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. He started manipulation for the same even inthe lifetime of late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. After his death, three Shankaracharyas ofdifferent Peeth, learned Pandits, Sanyasis and followers of Vedantic teachings, consideredappointment of a Sanyasi having requisite qualifications prescribed in "Mathamnaya" and"Mahanushasan". defendant-1 put forward his claim on the basis of alleged 'Will'. Said claim wasrejected by three Shankaracharyas, Pandits, Sanyasis and Sadhus of Vedantic Teachings.Defendant-1 had practically received no education and until few years he was working as bookbinder in Gita Press, Gorakhpur (U.P.). He was also not conversant with Sanskrit language andunable to interpret and explain Vedant Philosophy and other Shastras. Alleged 'Will' was afabricated document. Plaintiff has reason to believe that it was not executed by late SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati. Circumstances under which its execution was alleged, made it suspicious. Itwas not a genuine 'Will' of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. Moreover, he was not competent to makeany 'Will' nor competent to nominate successor or Successors as Peethadhishwar. He did not andcould not possess any property of his own. Property of Peeth held by him was in Trust and not aSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/43personal property, hence could not have been disposed of by making 'Will'. Swami BrahmanandSaraswati did not possess sound disposing mind when alleged 'Will' is said to have been executed on18.12.1952. He was suffering from sleeplessness and other ailments for a long time preceding thedate of alleged execution of 'Will'. For this reason also, 'Will' is invalid and does not have the effectof making defendant-1 Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth or clothe him with any right ortitle to hold and deal with property of Peeth. Defendant-1 did not possess requisite qualification forholding office of Shankaracharya. He was not validly chosen or installed Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and has no right or title to any part of property ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. As per rules and directions laid down in "Mathamnaya" and"Mahanushasan" as also customs and traditions of Peeth and directions contained in declarationgiven in Trust deed dated 11.05.1941, succession to the office of Shankaracharya of Peeth in questionhas to be approved by other three Peethas. Vidwat Parishad and Shankaracharyas of other threePeethas did not recognize alleged 'Will' propounded by defendant-1. They also found thatdefendant-1 did not possess necessary qualifications for holding high office of Shankaracharya.Defendant-1 did not become a duly appointed and installed Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. On the contrary, Vidvat Parishad selected Swami Krishna Bodhashram, agreat scholar and learned in Vedas, Vedantas and Shastras to hold office of Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. He was duly approved by Peethadhishwars of other three Peethas andinstalled as Peethadhishwar of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on or about 25.6.1953 and continued inoffice till his death, i.e. 10.09.1973. Defendant-1, taking undue advantage of saintliness of SwamiKrishna Bodhashram, took possession of some of the properties of Trust and started managing it asTrustee de son tort. Looking to welfare of Peeth, late Swami Krishna Bodhashram instituted suit-3of 1963 on 02.09.1963 in the Court of Civil Judge, Tehri Garhwal for declaration, possession andpermanent injunction against defendants, impleaded in Suit No. 1A of 1974 also. The said suit waspending at preliminary stage when Suit 1A of 1974 was filed. Swami Krishna Bodhashram fell ill inSeptember, 1973. He appointed plaintiff Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati to perform duties of theseat and manage affairs of Peeth during the period of his illness. On 10.09.1973 Swami KrishnaBodhashram breathed his last at Delhi. Before his death, he proposed name of plaintiff for the seatas new Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Once again the question of appointment ofShankaracharya arose and three Shankaracharyas of different Peeths, Pandits, learned men of KashiVidwat Parishad, Sanyasis, various religious institutions including B.D.M., VNS and followers of thePeeths, selected and appointed plaintiff as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Hepossessed all the qualifications prescribed in "Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan". Installationceremony was held at Delhi on 07.12.1973. Shankaracharya of Sharda Peeth and Goverdhan Peethpersonally offered Pattas to plaintiff. Shankaracharya of Shringeri Peeth had sent his representativewho offered Patta on his behalf in the aforesaid ceremony. Sanyasis, Grahasthas, Pandits andlearned scholars also participated in the ceremony. All necessary religious ceremonies wereperformed. After installation ceremony, a procession was taken out from Gandhi Maidan Delhi inwhich all the three Shankaracharyas including plaintiff participated. Procession terminated at AjmalKhan Park of Karol Bagh and turned into a huge Sabha in which various religious institutions ofDelhi, Haryana, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Bengal, including followers andleaders of Jain religion, Mandleshwars, Sanyasis and Grahsthas welcomed and acclaimed plaintiff asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and offered their homage. Since then, i.e. 07.12.1973plaintiff is Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, performing duties and responsibilities asSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/44Jyotishpeethadhishwar. In para 22 of the plaint, plaintiff gave his own credentials as under:"22. That, the plaintiff was attracted to the asceticism at a very early age of 13 years. The plaintiffstudied Sanskrit at Narsingpur and Kashi, and in the year 1941 joined Sanskrit Pathshala of villageRampur district Ghasipur. Before taking Danda (Sanyas) he accompanied many great religious andspiritual Sanyasis and Yogis namely Shri Vallabhanand, Shri Oriyababa, Sri Karpatriji, Late ShriKrishna Bodhashramji, Shri Maheshwaranandji, Sri Adyatanandji and Sri Akhandanandji etc. andlearnt and discussed with them Vedas, Vedangas, Upanishad, Shastras etc. His quest for knowledgebrought him to late Shankaracharya in the year 1950, and he is chela senior to the defendant No. 1.He was given Danda that is he became Dandi Sanyasi and was introduced to Dasnami order. Afterlearning the religious philosophies for some times the plaintiff left the late Shankaracharya SwamiBhahmanand to propagate the Shankar Philosophy and Sanathan Dharma Hindu religion. Theplaintiff mostly propagated Vedantic Teachings in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar andBengal and has a large number of followers in these states. In May, 1964, the plaintiff establishedAdhyatmic Utthan Mandal a registered body at Paramhanshi Ganga in Narsinghpur district inMadhya Pradesh which is a pioneer institution in Madhya Pradesh having branches in Bengal, Biharand Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat and is run by his followers to impart religious instructions accordingto Sanathan Hindu Dharma."85. Defendant-1 who declared himself Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, possessed aconsiderable part of Property of Peeth, detailed in Scheduled 'A' Part (i) (iii) of plaintiff. He alsovisited Seoni in last week of September 1973 and in first week of October 1973. Also at Seoni, hedeclared himself as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. His acts and declarations havethrown a cloud on the title of plaintiff and tended to create an atmosphere of misunderstanding andconfusion amongst the followers of Peeth. Defendant-1 is also laying claim over other properties ofPeeth, details whereof are given in Schedule 'A' Part (ii). He has also been and is claiming propertygiven in the Schedule 'A'. He filed an application before Naib Tehsildar, Tehsil Lakhnadan, villageSarangpur, District Seoni in Revenue Case No. 10/A-6/73-74. In this application he claims to beShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and owner of land situated in village Sarangpur, TehsilLakhnadon, District Seoni. Defendant-1 had previously made an application in Revenue case No.1/A-6 of 63-64 of village Sarangpur, S. No. 411, P.C. No. 73, Tehsil Lakhnadon District Seoni beforeNaib Tehsildar Lakhnadon, making a similar claim. Moreover, properties namely the deposits andGovernment loans and certificates detailed in Scheduled 'A' part (ii) to the plaint, are at present incustody of Registrar, High Court, Allahabad, Uttar Pradesh. Defendant-1 is asserting that he is alsoentitled to receive this property. He is making efforts to have the same delivered to him. Sincedefendant-1 is denying and interested to deny right and title of plaintiff, he is entitled to get adeclaration from Court that he is duly appointed and installed Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. He is also entitled to claim possession over properties of the Peethdetailed in Schedule 'A' Part (i), (ii) and (iii) and to have his possession over property of Schedule 'B'confirmed. Plaintiff is further entitled to have defendant no. 1 restrained from interfering with thepossession over the property of the Peeth. Defendants-2 and 3 have also been nominated in thealleged 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 by Brahmanand Saraswati, though neither they were qualified nor he(Brahmanand Saraswati) was entitled to nominate them for the reasons mentioned in earlier part ofthe plaint. Hence they are also arrayed as proforma defendants. In case they do not deny plaintiff'sSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/45right, no relief is claimed against them.86. For the purpose of cause of action and territorial jurisdiction plaintiff Swami SwaroopanandSaraswati, disclosed following facts in paragraphs 25 and 26 of the plaint in Original Suit No, 1-A of1974:"25. The cause of action for the suit arose partly at Seoni and at Lakhnadan, District Seoni and alsoat other places where the defedant No. 1 is giving himself out as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath. Itarose on 12.9.1973 when the plaintiff was duly selected for the holy office of the Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath and also on 7.12.1973 when the plaintiff was duly installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirpeeth and further in the months of September and October 1973 when the defendant No. 1proclaimed himself as Shankaracharya in Seoni and declared that he was also entitled to all theproperties of the Peeths including the properties in this district. It is further arising from day to dayas the defendant No. 1 is continuing to proclaim himself as Shankaracharya of Jyotishpeeths and tobe entitled to possession of all its properties.""26. Since a part of the property of the Peeths namely the lands in village Sarangpur are situated inthe District and since the defendant No. 1 has declared and proclaimed himself as Shankaracharyain this District and since he has been claiming and is claiming the property situated in this district,this Court has got jurisdiction to try this suit." (emphasis added)87. The aforesaid suit was transferred to Court of Civil Judge, Allahabad.88. Defendant-1 Ram Ji Tripathi (Swami Shantanand Saraswati) filed written statement dated30.10.1979. He denied that "Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan" were written by AdiShankaracharya or that the same contained any Rules and Regulations regarding appointment andqualification for appointment of Head of Peethas established by Adi Shankaracharya. He also saidthat the contents of books are neither mandatory nor have any binding character. It was also deniedthat Adi Shankaracharya had any primary object of establishing Math to maintain a competent lineof teacher. "Mathamnaya" of Jyotishpeeth does not prescribe any Rules, Regulations orqualifications of Peethadhishwar of Jyotishpeeth. Qualifications of earlier Peethadhishwar ofJyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth are also not known. Peeth remained unseated for about 165 years. SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati was installed as Shankaracharya thereafter. To this extent, avermentscontained in paragraphs 6 and 7 of plaint are admitted but rest averments are denied. It was alsoadmitted that B.D.M., VNS by Trust deed dated 11.5.1941 made over property which B.D.M., VNShad acquired and detailed in the said deed, to Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, but it was very small.Remaining property were acquired by Shankaracharya Swami Brahmanand Saraswati himselfduring period of his Peethadhishwar. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati discharged all duties andmanaged affairs with great ability. All properties were self acquired by Swami BrahmanandSaraswati. A Sanyasi can acquire property for Lok Sangrah. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati acquiredproperty and thereafter gave a part of it to Peeth under his 'Will'. It is denied that two books containany Rules and Regulations regarding any trust or that they are mandatory in character. SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati breathed his last on 20.05.1953. Rest averments stated in para 11 aredenied. The allegation that defendant-1 was keeping an eye over seat and manipulating and makingSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/46efforts to acquire it, was denied. Defendant-1 is fully qualified and educated in Sanskrit and wellconversant in Vedant philosophy and Shastras. He was considered fully qualified to hold office ofShankaracharya of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeethbeing Guru of defendant-1 and he was competent person to do so. 'Will' is genuine, valid andexecuted by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. He was of sound disposing mind and allegationsotherwise were denied. There is custom in all the Peethas of Shankaracharya that sittingShankaracharya nominates his successor. Following the same custom, Swami BrahmanandSaraswati nominated four persons, placed defendant-1 at first place in the line of succession.Learned men of KVP had nothing to do with such appointment or installation of successor and haveno say in the matter. Death of Swami Krishna Bodhashram on 10.9.1971 was admitted but restcontents of paragraph 16 were denied. Possession of property by defendant in his own right as JagatGuru Shankaracharya was admitted and allegations otherwise were denied. Filing of suit by SwamiKrishna Bodhashram for possession of Peeth and its properties was admitted and rest contents ofparagraph 18 were denied. Swami Krishna Bodhashram was never Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and had no right or title to nominate anyone as Shankaracharya and, infact, he did not do so. He himself was not duly installed Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeethand was restrained by Court permanently to call himself or let other call him Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth in Original Suit 36 of 1965, decided by Civil Judge, Allahabad. Plaintiff'sclaim as Shankaracharya or that he could be installed as Shankaracharya, was also denied.Defendant-1 was installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 12.6.1953and has been so recognized by public at large. He rightly asserted right to possess and protectproperty of Peeth. In additional pleas, defendant-1 said that Adi Shankaracharya was not and couldnot be author of "Mathamnaya" and 'Mahanushasan" and they do not contain Rules. It is onlydescriptive in nature. Shlokas quoted in the plaint do not find place in "Mathamnaya" ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Meaning ascribed to Shlokas is not correct. In any case, guidance given in"Mathamnaya" is only recommendatory and not mandatory. No direction or guidance is given in"Mathamnaya" of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Adi Shankaracharya nominated and appointed personsof his choice as Peethadhishwar and that is what has been done by Successors of different Peethasby nominating and appointing disciples as their Successors in whom they had confidence andconsidered most suitable. Usage and longstanding custom of all four Peethas of Shankaracharyas isthat disciple nominated by ruling Shankaracharya is installed as Successor after death or retirement,as the case may be. On the death of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati on 20.5.1953, defendant-1 beingnominated as Successor and available for installation, left no occasion for treating Math as Uchhina(vacant) and assertion that there was situation of absence of Mathadhish is not correct. Further afterinstallation of defendant-1 as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 12.6.1953 there was noquestion of installation of anyone else. Qualifications allegedly mentioned in Shlokas quoted in theplaint did not relate to any academic attainments nor can be publishable in the present age. They arenot capable of assessment by Court of law. Only one's Guru- reigning Shankaracharya can assessthem with authority. There cannot be any objective yardstick to measure objective qualitiesmentioned in the Shlokas quoted in the plaint. Swami Brahmanand Saraswati left his home at anearly age of 9 years, being impregnated with feelings of detachment towards worldly affairs. He didnot have the advantage of modern type of school education. Being a Sadhu by nature and a devotee,lying at the feet of his Guru, he was considered suitable and installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. He discharged duties and responsibilities of the said office most efficientlySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/47till his death. He made arrangement to ensure that Math does not go into a State of desolation againfor at-least four generations to come and he was able to do this by grace and blessings of his Guru.He acquired and possessed property by purchase and other modes of transfer, before and after hisinstallation as Shankaracharya. Properties held by him are in his own rights, in addition to smallproperty received by him under the deed dated 11.05.1941. There is no restriction provided in thedeed for nomination of Successor by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati nor it would have beencontained otherwise. Said deed only handed over property to head of Math who is just a custodian.Swami Brahmanand Saraswati did not accept any monetary gifts or offerings from his disciples. Hedid not accept anything without making proper payment and whatever acquired was from hispersonal resources. A Sanyasi can hold and possess personal property and deal with the same forgood and welfare of mankind (Loksangrah). Adi Shankaracharya had not oriented idea of Trust asunderstood in English law anywhere in his writings relating to four Mathas established by him.Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth was the type of institution where succession passes from Guru to Chelathorugh nomination by Guru and is a sort of "Maursi Math". He has full right to appoint hisSuccessor Shankaracharya and there was no disability on his part in doing so. He executed his last'Will' on 18.12.1952 of his own accord and freewill without any pressure and influence with fullknowledge and in sound disposing state of mind. 'Will' was duly attested and executed. SwamiHariharanand also known as Swami Karpatriji, a disciple of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, startedtaking part in politics under the name and banner of Ram Rajya Parishad which was objected bySwami Brahmanand Saraswati. Since Swami Karpatriji did not obey dictates of Swami BrahmanandSaraswati, "Will" dated 18.12.1953 was executed to nominate Successor other than SwamiHariharanand. After death of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati on 20.05.1953, the only question cameup for consideration and unanimously decided, was to find out who was named as his Successor inhis "Will", which was deposited with District Registrar, Allahabad in safe custody. Thereafter,proceedings were initiated for obtaining "Will" from the office of District Registrar, Allahabad.Defendant 1 was installed with due observance of procedure and ceremony befitting the occasion.Defendant-1 was neither at Kashi nor near it. He was called telegraphically for the purpose ofceremony by Sri Bal Krishna Misra, Secretary of Interim Committee and also of B.D.M., VNS.Defendant-1 was not a member of the aforesaid Interim Committee. The said Committee wasconstituted in a public meeting under the Presidentship of Swami Karpatriji Maharaj. Installationceremony of defendant-1 took place at Brahmnivas, Sidh Giri Bagh, Varanasi. Defendant-1 is aSanyasi and disciple of late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati. He possessed all the good qualities andlearning of knowledge desirable for the office of Jagat Guru Shankaracharya. In fact, plaintiff as wellas Swami Karpatriji were expecting something else than what "Will" disclosed and therefore,Karpatriji set up a parallel claim through Swami Krishna Bodhashram for his own benefit. Plaintiffhad all along an eye to usurp the office of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. He has all along been abusingthe process of law by undesirable actions not suited to a Sanyasi. First such action was anapplication filed under Section 144 Cr.P.C. to obstruct function under the "Will" i.e. installationceremony of defendant-1 but the same failed and ceremony actually took place. Thereafter, plaintiffset up a claim to contest defendant-1 in the Succession Certificate proceedings in Misc. Case No.44of 1953 before District Judge, Allahabad but lost vide order dated 13.12.1955 passed by Civil Judge,Allahabad. His appeal also failed in High Court, vide judgment dated 31.07.1959 in F.A.F.O. No.20of 1956. Thereafter, succession certificate was granted in favour of defendant-1. Next proceedingswere initiated under Section 92 C.P.C. which resulted in filing of suit 3 of 1954 and another suit filedSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/48by Swami Krishna Bodhashram being suit 3 of 1963. In view of suit 3 of 1963 instituted by plaintiffhimself, it was pleaded that suit 1A of 1974 was not maintainable, being barred by res judicata.Plaintiff is claiming to be a representative of Swami Krishna Bodhashram , hence present suit is alsobarred by Order 22 Rule 9 C.P.C. KVP has no right to install Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth nor B.D.M., VNS or any particular Sadhu or group of Sadhus have anyright to appoint Shankaracharya. Plaintiff is a puppet of Swami Karpatriji and has been set up toharass defendant-1. Swami Krishna Bodhashram never had possession of property of a Math. Inorder to set up the said controversy at rest, defendant-1 filed a Suit 36 of 1965 against SwamiKrishna Bodhashram which was decreed. Suit in question, therefore, is also barred for that reasonby the principles of res-judicata. Plaintiff is not possessed of the qualifications, has no right to seeany declaration. His conduct and act also justify denial of any relief by Court. Defendant-1 is aSanyasi disciple of late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, duly qualified and nominated by lastShankaracharya, to be installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, and, evenotherwise, he has full right to hold the said office and otherwise claim set up by plaintiff is notcorrect. Plaintiff is not in possession of property in suit i.e. property of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth.Defendant-1 is managing the property succeeded from Swami Brahmanand Saraswati and that ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth.89. We are informed that Suit 1-A of 1974 is still pending. An objection raised for stay of suit inquestion by filing application section 10 CPC but it has not been accepted by Trial Court and it hasdecided otherwise. We also find that all the three defendants have already died long back andtherefore for all practical purposes above Suit must have abated.Arguments before this Court90. Learned counsel for parties addressed this Court, orally, at length and matter has been heard onvarious dates; for about more than 2 months. Besides, parties, as requested, were also permitted tofile their written submissions and both have filed voluminous written submissions in support oftheir respective contentions taking more than two months' time after the judgment was reserved. Alarge numbers of Reference books as well as precedents were cited at the Bar and also referred inwritten submissions, which we propose to deal with at appropriate stage in this judgment.91. In brief, objections taken by Sri Goel to the correctness of judgment in appeal is based on theplea of Section 10 CPC contending that Original Suit No. 1-A of 1974 involving same matter isalready sub-judice, therefore, suit in question, being subsequent, could not have proceeded andTrial Court erred in law in rejecting application of defendant-appellant to stay the suit. He furthercontended that suit in question rendered infructuous after installation of appellant asShankaracharya on 14/15.11.1989, hence, was liable to be rejected but Trial Court erred in law intaking an otherwise view. He thirdly contended that issues in question relating to the office ofShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth were already adjudicated between the parties underwhom plaintiff-respondent claimed his right in the instant suit inasmuch Original Suit No. 36 of1965 was already decided finally in which 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 was held valid, installation ofSwami Shantanand Saraswati was also upheld and claim of Swami Krishnabodhashram wasnegated, hence in that view of the matter suit in question and issues raised therein are barred bySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/49principle of res-judicata and here also, Court below has erred in law.92. He next contended that 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 was not challenged by plaintiff and nodeclaration was sought within the period of limitation, hence, challenge to same was barred bylimitation. It, thus, was not open to plaintiff to challenge installation of appellant asShankaracharya. He has indirectly assailed 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 though even directly it was notpermissible having become barred by limitation. He also submitted that with regard to installationof plaintiff, there was no valid evidence, and, even otherwise, there was no pleading of material factsin the plaint with regard to alleged disqualification of appellant to hold the office of Shankaracharyaand for that reason itself plaint deserves to be rejected and suit ought to have been dismissed.93. Sri Shashi Nandan, Sri W.H. Khan, learned Senior Advocates, and Sri P.N. Mishra, Advocate,assisted by Sri Anoop Trivedi, who have argued the matter on behalf of plaintiff, not only replied theaforesaid arguments but pointed out that there are some other aspects also and advanced theirarguments accordingly.94. In brief, learned counsel for plaintiff argued that judgment in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965cannot be held res-judicata since appeal against judgment of Trial Court stood abated due to deathof appellant, Swami Krishnabodhashram, and, hence, said judgment did not attain finality andcould not have been treated as res judicata against plaintiff. With regard to disqualification andother deficiencies on the part of appellant in holding office of Shankaracharya it was urged thatrequisite pleadings were already available in the plaint and only sought to be detailed byamendment, hence, rejection of amendment of plaint would make no difference for the reason thatsuch details could have been made available by adducing evidence to which there was no objectionon the part of appellant and both the parties have led evidence in detail with regard to qualification,disqualification, if any, of both. The argument of appellant is without any substance. It is furtherpleaded that relief sought in the plaint is in two parts, on the first part an injunction is soughtagainst the very act of installation since on the date when plaint was filed before Court below andregistered, installation of appellant as Shankaracharya had not taken place but simultaneously reliefsought in the plaint is wide enough to cover a situation where appellant is installed, then there is arequest also to restrain him from working as Shankaracharya and to hold decorations meant forShankaracharya, i.e., Danda, Chhatra Chanwar and Singhasan etc. It was pleaded that requisitepleadings were already available before Court below and argument with regard to absence ofmaterial facts is thoroughly misconceived.95. Lastly on the question of installation, it was argued that enough evidence is available on recordto show valid installation of plaintiff as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth and Courtbelow has also recorded a finding in his favour which is based on evidence and nothing has beenshown to be perverse or contrary to record. With regard to incompetence of appellant to hold theoffice of Shankaracharya, it is pointed out that qualifications are laid down in Mathamanya andMahanusasanam, the two works of distinction, containing Rules and Regulations laid by Adi GuruShankaracharya and fulfillment thereof is mandatory. A person who lacks such qualifications orrequirements to become Shankaracharya, as provided in the said books, cannot hold Office or statusof Shankaracharya, hence, appellant has rightly been injuncted by Court below vide judgment underSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/50appeal.96. We have heard learned counsels, perused written submissions and considered various citationsand reference books relied by them. We propose to consider the same in detail with respect torespective points for determination in the light of relevant evidence, reference books and citationsrelied by both parties.Marking of Documents as exhibit97. Before proceeding further, one of the objections raised on behalf of appellant is with respect todocumentary evidence. It is said that most of the documents have not been marked 'Exhibit'. Courtbelow has not proceeded to admit document in evidence in accordance with procedure prescribed inthe Rules. Therefore, here is a judgment which has been rendered on the basis of documents, notadmissible in evidence, having not been marked Exhibits, hence, it is patently illegal, based on nolegal evidence and, for this reason alone, judgment and decree in question deserve to be set aside.98. We propose to deal with this aspect of the matter since 815 documents were filed before TrialCourt in evidence by plaintiff -respondent and 361 documents were filed by appellant. It is reallystrange that documents have not been marked 'Exhibit'. Documents, when filed were given PaperNumbers. The same paper numbers have been referred in the judgment under appeal.99. We do not find even any process of admission or denial of documents by other side as alsoprocess of marking of Exhibit by Court below in regard to such documents. Interestingly, we also donot find any objection on the part of either side, before Court below, with regard to admissibility ofeven a single document. Parties have addressed Court, it appears, on the basis of documentsreferring to Paper Numbers without any whisper towards objection that unless a document isexhibited and admitted in evidence, there is no question of treating it a valid evidence in the eyes oflaw for the purpose of deciding suit. By conduct both the parties have accepted procedure followedby Court below by treating documents filed and given paper numbers, constituting valid evidencefor the purpose of deciding suit.100. Whether at appellate stage, such objection should be entertained or allowed to be raised byeither of parties and judgment of Trial Court can be held vitiated in law for considering documentswhich were not exhibited by Court below, is an issue which has to be seen by this Court. If decided infavour of appellant, as per objection raised by Sri Manish Goel, it will go to the root of the mattersince this Court, then would have no option but to set aside judgment and remand the matter toCourt below, otherwise we can proceed to decide appeal on merits.101. In this regard, we find relevant provisions in C.P.C. as well as General Rules (Civil), 1957(hereinafter referred to as "GR(C), 1957") applicable to subordinate Courts in State of U.P., withrespect of the procedure to be followed in Civil Matters.102. Procedure of filing suits and manner in which the same are to be tried and further provisions ofappeal, revision etc. are broadly governed by CPC, a statute enacted by Central Legislation. SinceSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/51District Courts are subordinate to High Court and procedural aspects can also be monitored by HighCourt under Section 122 C.P.C., hence power has also been given to High Court to frame Rulesregulating procedure of Civil Courts subject to superintendence and by such rules annul, alter or addto all or any of the rules in the first schedule which contains various provisions, divided in 52 orders.103. In exercise of supervisory powers under Article 227 of Constitution of India read with Section122 CPC, GR (C), 1957 have been notified in supersession of all existing Rules on the subject. TheseRules have 28 Chapters dealing with different aspects of procedure to be followed not only in trial ofcivil suits etc. but also tell subordinate Courts, manner of maintenance of record of variousproceedings and other administrative aspects.104. Chapter III is one of the most important Chapter which deals with procedure of institution ofsuit, as to how it shall proceed. It also deals with appeals in general. Chapter III is sub-divided innine parts, i.e., from (A) to (I).105. Part (A) deals with parties to the proceedings; (B) with applications and pleadings; (C) withDocuments; (D) Commissions; (E) Affidavits; (F) Adjournments; (G) Hearing of suit; (H) Transferor withdrawal of cases; and, (I) Judgment and decree.106. For the purpose of present matter, we are confining our discussion with respect to documentswhich were filed in Trial Court, as to how they would have dealt with, proceeded and exhibited forthe purpose of deciding suit. Relevant rules in this regard are Rules 40 to 64 in Part C, Chapter IIIand the same have to be read with Order XIII CPC.107. Order XIII deals with production, impounding and return of documents. Rule 1 thereof as itstands today, substituted by CPC Amendment Act, 1999 (hereinafter referred to as "AmendmentAct, 1999") w.e.f. 01.07.2002. Earlier Rule 1 reads as under:-"1. Documentary evidence to be produced at or before the settlement of issues.--(1) The parties ortheir pleaders shall produce, at or before the settlement of issues all the documentary evidence ofevery description in their possession or power, on which they intend to rely, and which has notalready been filed in Court, and all documents which the Court has ordered to be produced.(2) The Court shall receive the documents so produced: Provided that they are accompanied by anaccurate list thereof prepared in such form as the High Court directs."108. The substituted Rule 1 which is effective from 01.07.2002, reads as under:"1. Original documents to be produced at or before the settlement of issues.-(1) The parties or their pleader shall produce on or before the settlement of issues, all thedocumentary evidence in original where the copies thereof have been filed along with the plaint orwritten statement.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/52(2) The Court shall receive the documents so produced:Provided that they are accompanied by an accurate list thereof prepared in such form as the HighCourt directs.(3) Nothing in sub-rule (1) shall apply to documents--(a) produced for the cross-examination of the witnesses of the other party; or(b) handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory."(emphasis added)109. This is consistent with Order VII Rule 14 in respect of documents of plaintiff and Order VIIIRule 1A in respect of documents of defendants. Both these rules have also undergone amendment bysubstitution and Order VII Rule 14 and Order VIII Rule 1A, as inserted by Amendment Act, 1999,read as under:-Order VII, Rule 14 before Amendment "Rule 14. Production of document on which plaintiff sues--(1)Where a plaintiff sues upon a document in his possession or power, he shall produce it in Courtwhen the plaint is presented, and shall at the same time deliver the document or a copy thereof to befiled with the plaint.List of other documents.--(2) Where he relies on any other documents (whether in his possession orpower or not) as evidence in support of his claim, he shall enter such documents in a list to be addedor annexed to the plaint."Order VII, Rule 14 after Amendment "14. Production of document on which plaintiff sues orrelies.-(1) Where a plaintiff sues upon a document or relies upon document in his possession orpower in support of his claim, he shall enter such documents in a list, and shall produce it in Courtwhen the plaint is presented by him and shall, at the same time deliver the document and a copythereof, to be filed with the plaint.(2) Where any such documents not in the possession or power of the plaintiff, he shall, whereverpossible, state in whose possession or power it is.(3) A document which ought to be produced in Court by the plaintiff when the plaint is presented, orto be entered in the list to be added or annexed to the plaint but is not produced or enteredaccordingly, shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at thehearing of the suit.(4) Nothing in this rule shall apply to document--(a) produced for the cross examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/53(b) handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory."Order VIII Rule 1A (inserted by Amendment Act, 1999) "1A. Duty of defendant to producedocuments upon which relief is claimed or relied upon by him.- (1) Where the defendant bases hisdefence upon a document or relies upon any document in his possession or power, in support of hisdefence or claim for set off or counter claim, he shall enter such document in a list, and shallproduce it in Court when the written statement is presented by him and shall, at the same time,deliver the document and a copy thereof, to be filed with the written statement.(2) Where any such document is not in the possession or power of the defendant, he shall, whereverpossible, state in whose possession or power it is.(3) A document which ought to be produced in Court by the defendant under this rule, but, is not soproduced shall not, without the leave of the Court, be received in evidence on his behalf at thehearing of the suit.(4) Nothing in this rule shall apply to documents--(a) produced for the cross-examination of the plaintiff's witnesses, or(b) handed over to a witness merely to refresh his memory."(emphasis added)110. Order XIII Rule 1 now creates an obligation upon parties or their pleader to produce originaldocuments on or before settlement of Issues. Order XIII Rule 2 earlier provided effect ofnon-production of documents but now by Amendment Act, 1999 it has been omitted. If primaryevidence i.e. original document is not available and party intends to lead secondary evidence, thenall conditions provided in Evidence Act have to be satisfied. Rule 3 permits a Court to reject adocument at any stage of the suit which it considers irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible afterrecording grounds of such rejection. Rule 4 contemplates endorsement on the documents admittedin evidence and it has to be done by Court since such endorsement has to be signed or initialed byPresiding Officer of the Court. It reads as under:-"4. Endorsements on documents admitted in evidence.- (1) Subject to the provisions of the nextfollowing sub-rule, there shall be endorsed on every document which has been admitted in evidencein the Suit the following particulars, namely:--(a) the number and title of the suit,(b) the name of the person producing the document,(c) the date on which it was produced, andSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/54(d) a statement of its having been so admitted;and the endorsement shall be signed or Initialed by the judge.(2) Where a document so admitted is an entry in a book, account or record, and a copy thereof hasbeen substituted for the original under the next following rule, the particulars aforesaid shall beendorsed on the copy and the endorsement thereon shall be signed or initialed by the Judge."(emphasis added)111. Order XIII Rule 5 provides for endorsement on copies of admitted entries in books, accountsand records. Rule 6 talks of endorsement of documents rejected as inadmissible. The Rules read asunder:-"5. Endorsements on copies of admitted entries in books, accounts and records.- (1) Save in so far asotherwise provided by the Bankers' Books Evidence Act, 1891 (XVIII of 1891), where a documentadmitted in evidence in the suit is an entry in a letter book or a shop book or other account incurrent use, the party on whose behalf the book or account is produced may furnish a copy of theentry.(2) Where such a document is an entry in a public record produced from a public office or by apublic officer, or an entry in a book or account belonging to a person other than a party on whosebehalf the book or account is produced, the Court may require a copy of the entry to be furnished--(a) where the record, book or account is produced on behalf of a party, then by that party, or(b) Where the record, book or account is produced in obedience to an Order of the Court acting of itsown motion, then by either or any party.(3) Where a copy of an entry is furnished under the foregoing provisions of this rule, the Court shall,after causing the copy to be examined, compared and certified in manner mentioned in rule 17 ofOrder VII, mark the entry and cause the book, account or record in which its occurs to be returnedto the person producing it.""6. Endorsements on documents rejected as inadmissible in evidence.- Where a document relied onas evidence by either party is considered by the Court to be inadmissible in evidence, there shall beendorsed there or the particulars mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (c) of Rule 4, sub-rule (1),together with a statement of its having been rejected, and the endorsement shall be signed orinitialled by the Judge." (emphasis added)112. Order XIII Rule 7 CPC provides that documents which are admitted in evidence shall form partof record of suit. The documents not admitted in evidence shall not form part of record and shall bereturned to the persons respectively producing them.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/55113. Order XIII Rule 8 CPC empowers Court to impound a document and keep in the custody ofofficer of Court, if it sees sufficient cause, for such period and subject to such conditions, as Courtthinks fit.114. Order XIII Rule 9 provides for return of admitted documents after suit is disposed of and, eithertime for filing appeal has expired or appeal has been disposed of. Proviso covers a situation where adocument may be returned at any time earlier than the period provided hereinabove in certainconditions. Rule 10 states that Court may, of its own motion, and discretion, upon application of anyof the parties to suit, send for, either from its own records or from any other Court, record of anyother suit or proceeding, and inspect the same. Conditions applicable when such order is passed onthe application, are contained in sub-rule 2 of Rule 10. Sub-rule 3 declares that Rule 10 shall notenable Court to use in evidence, any document which under the law of evidence would beinadmissible in suit. Rule 11 extends provisions relating to documents to all other material objectsproducible as evidence.115. In the context of Order XIII CPC, further detailed provisions have been given under GR (C),1957.116. Rule 40 of GR (C), 1957 specifies the persons who may produce documents in the Court andsays that it may be by parties, by persons, other than parties and on requisition issued by Court.Rule 41 imposes an obligation where the documents produced by party or his witness is in alanguage other than Hindi, Urdu or English and says that it shall be accompanied by a correcttranslation of the document in Hindi, written in Devnagri script. Such translation shall bear acertificate of party's lawyer to the effect that the translation is correct. If parties are not representedby a lawyer, Court shall have the translation certificate of any person appointed by it in this behalf atthe cost of the party concerned.117. Rule 42 of GR (C), 1957 contemplates that parties desiring to produce any document in Court,shall, before producing it in any Court, obtain admission or denial, recorded on back of thedocument by the opposite party's lawyer. If opposite party is not represented by lawyer, Court shallget admission or denial by the party in its presence and may, for the purpose, examine the party.118. Rule 43 lays procedure of list of documents contemplated in Order VII Rule 14 and Order XIIIRule 1 CPC and says that such list of documents shall be in form (part IV-71). It further says that nodocument whensoever produced, shall be received unless accompanied by the said form duly filledup. In case a document is produced by a witness or person summoned to produce documents, formshall be supplied by the parties at whose instance the document is produced. It also requires that listas well as the documents shall be immediately entered in the general index.119. If there is any erasures or additions in the documents, other than a registered documents orcertified copy, Rule 44 of GR (C), 1957 states that such document shall be accompanied by astatement clearly describing such erasure, addition or inter- alienation and signed by such party.Reference to such statement shall be made in the list form (part IV-71) with which paper is filed.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/56120. Rule 45 is basically a provision for safety and convenience of perusal of documents when it is asmall piece of paper or of historic value or written on both sides. It reads as under:-"45. Small documents and documents of historic value.--Small documents when filed in Court shallbe filed pasted on a paper equal to the size of the record, and the margin of the paper should bestitched to the file so that no part of the document is concealed by the stitching. If a documentcontains writing both on the front and the back, it should be kept in a separate cover, which shouldbe stitched to the file at the proper place leaving the main document untouched."121. When a party requires production of a public record, Rule 46 says that application shall besubmitted by such party accompanied by an affidavit showing how such party requiring record hassatisfied itself that it is material to the suit and why a certified copy of document cannot be producedor will not serve the purpose.122. When a public record is ordered to be produced but its production require sanction of Head ofDepartment, Rule 47 deals with such a situation and says as under:-"47. Documents for production of which sanction of head of department is necessary.--When aCourt decides that in the interests of justice it is necessary that it should have before it a documentwhich cannot be produced without the sanction of the head of the department concerned, it shall inits order asking for such document set out as clearly as possible (a) the facts, for the proof of whichthe production of the document is sought; (b) the exact portion or portions of the documentrequired as evidence of the facts sought to be proved. The Court summoning the document shall fixa date for its production, which should not be less than three weeks from the date of issue ofsummons."123. Rule 48 deals with public record of different offices like Sub Registrar, Police, Municipal andDistrict Board and Post Office and says as under:-"48. Registers from Sub-Registrar's office.--(1) A summons for the production of any register orbook belonging to the office of a Sub-Registrar shall be addressed to the District Registrar and notdirect to the Sub-Registrar.(2) Production of documents in police custody.-A summons for the production of documents in thecustody of the police should be addressed to the Superintendent of Police concerned, and not to theInspector General.(3) Production of Municipal and District Board Records.-When duly authenticated and certifiedcopies of documents in the possession of Municipal and District Boards15 are admissible inevidence, the Court shall not send for original records unless, after perusal of copies filed, the Courtis satisfied that the production of the original is absolutely necessary.(4) Post Office records not to be unnecessarily disclosed.-When any journal or other record of a postoffice is produced in Court, the Court shall not permit any portion of such journal or record to beSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/57disclosed, other than the portion or portions which seem to the Court necessary for thedetermination of the case then before it."124. For summoning of settlement record, procedure is prescribed in Rule 49 and reads as under:-"49. Settlement Records.--When a Court requires the production of any Settlement Record in whichthe Settlement Officer acted in a judicial capacity, it shall be summoned in the manner provided byOrder XIII, Rule10. In other cases the procedure prescribed in Order XVI, Rule 6 shall be followed.The summons to produce such documents shall be issued to the Collector/Deputy Commissioner,who may send the document by messenger or registered post."125. Rule 50 deals with payment of postage fee, travelling charges and other expenses fortransmission or requisition of record etc. Rule 51 says that documents received by registered post,then the registered cover shall not be destroyed but shall be attached to the file of proceedings in thecase to which the document is referred.126. Then comes Rule 52 which says that all documents, must be received by the Court and must bedealt with in one or the other of three means i.e. (a) returned; (b) placed on record; and (c)impounded.127. Thereafter Rule 53 imposes a duty upon Court to inspect documents as soon as they areproduced before Court. It says that documents which are proved or admitted by party against whomthey are produced in evidence, shall be marked as 'exhibit' in the manner prescribed in Rule 57 andthis fact shall be noted in the record. The document which are not proved or not admitted by partiesagainst whom they are produced in Court, shall be kept in record pending proof and shall berejected at the close of evidence, if not proved or admitted. Documents that are found to beirrelevant or otherwise inadmissible in evidence shall be rejected forthwith. There is also a noteunder Rule 53 stating that no document unless admitted in evidence shall be marked as an exhibit.128. Rule 54 of GR (C), 1957 clarifies that admission of genuineness is not to be confused withadmission of truth of contents and reads as under:"54. Admission of genuineness not to be confused with admission of truth of contents.-(1)When acertified copy of any private document is produced in Court, inquiry shall be made from the oppositeparty whether he admits that it is a true and correct copy of the document which he also admits, orwhether it is a true and correct copy of the document which he denies, or whether it is a true andcorrect copy of the document the genuineness of which he admits without admitting the truth of itscontents, or whether he denies the correctness of the copy as well as of the document itself.Admission of the genuineness of a document is not to be confused with the admission of the truth ofits contents or with the admission that such document is relevant or sufficient to prove any allegedfact. (emphasis added)Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/58129. The expression which are to be used by parties while admitting or not admitting documents, isprovided in Rule 55 and reads as under:"55. Proper expression about admissions of documents.-Admission of a document by a party shallbe indicated by the endorsement "Admitted by the plaintiff" or "Admitted by the defendant".Admission of a document in evidence by the Court shall be indicated by the endorsement "Admittedin evidence". If any question is raised as to the correctness of a copy and the correctness of its isadmitted, the endorsement shall be "correctness of copy admitted". The use of the expression"Admitted as a copy" in endorsement on document is prohibited."(emphasis added)130. Rule 56 talks of documents filed in suits which are compromised or dismissed in default andsays:"56. Endorsement on documents in suits compromised or dismissed for default.-Documents filed insuits, which are dismissed for default or compromised, shall, before being dealt with in the mannerprovided in Rules 59 and 60 be endorsed with the particulars mentioned in Order XIII, Rule 4(i)and the result of the suit."131. Rule 57 provides the manner in which marking is to be made in documents and reads as under :"57. Marking of documents.-(1) Documents produced by a plaintiff and duly admitted in evidenceshall be marked with a number, and documents produced by a defendant shall be marked with anumber and the letter A, or, where there are more than one set of defendants by the letter A for thefirst set of defendants, by the letter B for the second, and so on. Where a document is produced byorder of the Court and is not produced by any party, the serial number shall be prefaced by thewords "Court Exhibit" or an abbreviation of the same.(2) Where a document is produced by a witness at the instance of a party, the number of the witnessshall be endorsed thereon, e.g., Ex.P.W.1 if it is produced by the plaintiff's first witness, andEx.-A/D.W.1 if it is produced by the defendant's first witness.(3) The party at whose instance a document is produced by a witness shall deposit the cost of thepreparation of a certified copy of that document before it is placed on the record. The office shallthen prepare a certified copy and keep it with the original document. If the witness wants to takeback his document it shall be returned to him unless there are special reasons for keeping theoriginal on the record.Provided that a certified copy shall not be necessary where the document is written in a languageother than Hindi or English, and a translation has been filed as prescribed by Rule 41.(4) Every exhibit-mark shall be initialed and dated by the Judge."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/59(emphasis added)132. If a number of documents of same nature are admitted than the manner in which suchdocuments are marked, is provided in Rule 58 as under:"58. Marking of documents.- Where a number of documents of the same nature are admitted, as forexample, a series of receipt for rent, the whole series should bear one figure or capital letter orletters, a small figure or letter in brackets being added to distinguish each paper of the series."(emphasis added)133. Rule 59 states that documents which are rejected as irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible underOrder 13 Rule 3 CPC or not proved, unless impounded under Order 13 Rule 8 or rendered whollyvoid or useless by force of decree, be returned to the person producing it or to the pleader and suchperson or pleader shall give a receipt for same in column 4 of list (Form Part IV-71).134. Rules 60 and 61 of GR (C), 1957 deal with retention of impounded and certain other documentsand care of impounded documents. Rule 63 talks with the manner in which documents are to bereturned. Rule 64 specifically concerned with books of business and read as under:"64. Books of business.-If a document be an entry in a letter book, a shop book, or other account incurrent use or an entry in a public record, produced from a public office or by a public officer, a copyof the entry, certified in the manner required by law, shall be substituted on the record before thebook, account or record is returned, and the necessary endorsement should be made thereon, asrequired by Order XIII, Rule 5."135. These are the provisions relating to procedure and have been designed to facilitate procedurefor imparting justice. The procedural law is not to be dealt as a penal enactment and too technicalconstruction thereof is not needed. This is what has been said by Hon'ble Vivian Bose, J in SangramSingh vs. Election Tribunal, Kotah and another, 1955(2) SCR 1 and we quote relevant observationsas under:"Now a code of procedure must be regarded as such. It is procedure, something designed to facilitatejustice and further its ends : not a Penal enactment for punishment and penalties; not a thingdesigned to trip people up. Too technical construction of sections that leaves no room for reasonableelasticity of interpretation should therefore be guarded against (provided always that justice is doneto both sides) lest the very means designed for the furtherance of justice be used to frustrate it."136. Having said so, it also cannot be forgotten that the procedure laid down is not meant fordefiance but has to be observed. Evidence is the foundation of every case since in our system ofjustice, disputes are decided, whether Civil or Criminal, on the basis of evidence which may be oralor documentary. Therefore, rules dealing with procedure as to how a document will become anevidence is of great importance and such procedure must be adhered. Normal requirement underRules is that provisions relating to endorsement of document admitted in evidence should be strictlySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/60followed. The procedure of admission of a document as an evidence is not to be termed as a meretechnical aspect inasmuch as evidence is basic foundation for deciding a civil or criminal case, as thecase may be, and, therefore, an evidence must be exhibited strictly in accordance with the procedurelaid down in the Rules, since that is the procedure consistent with principles of natural justice sothat no party to the proceedings is taken by surprise or suffers on account of consideration of amaterial which was inadmissible in evidence or not proved or not admitted in evidence but stillrelied for deciding the matter as the same would render the judgment erroneous having relying on amaterial which is not admissible in evidence. There may be cases where though procedural aspectshave been observed in substance and there may be some error which may not go to the root of thematter and that may not be taken by the superior Court, in the facts and circumstances of a givencase, to hold judgment of lower Court as vitiated in law but normal rule is adherence to theprocedure prescribed in rules so that no such occasion may arise.137. In the past, on different occasions and in particular in the light of facts of those cases, deviationin process of marking of evidence or admitting of documents has been allowed to stay and has notvitiated proceedings but a close scrutiny of such matters will reveal that such occasions existed dueto peculiar facts of those matters. In order to avoid injustice to one or other party Courts have notheld a document inadmissible at a later stage but general law is that in order to make a document,exhibit, procedure prescribed under rules should be adhered to.138. Even Legislature has intervened by amending Order 13 Rule 1 and now parties have to filedocumentary evidence in original. This is clearly with the intention to avoid any scope of filingfictitious, manufactured or otherwise vitiating documents, particularly when scientific developmenthas made things much easier to create any kind of manipulation in a document very conveniently.Courts are under a duty that before it treat a document, evidence, it should follow the procedurestrictly. Unless a document is admitted or proved as evidence and marked 'exhibit', same obviouslyshould not be relied to decide a dispute. Marking of mere paper number and decision of a case onthat basis is not correct as it leaves to guess whether case is decided on legally admissible andproved evidence or not. It may amount to render a decision on the basis of documents inadmissiblein evidence.139. In Sadik Husain Khan vs Hashim Ali Khan and others, 1916 ILR (38) All 627, JudicialCommittee said:"Their Lordships, with a view of insisting on the observance of the wholesome provisions of theseStatutes, will, in order to prevent injustice, be obliged in future on the hearing of Indian appeals torefuse to read or permit to be used any document not endorsed in the manner required."(emphasis aded)140. In Secretary of State vs. (Shrimati) Sarla Devi Chaudhrani, AIR 1924 Lahore 548 followed inHari Singh vs. Firm Karam Chand-Kanshi Ram, AIR 1927 Lahore 115 and Imam-ud-Din and Anr. vs.Sri Ram Perbhu Dial, AIR 1928 Lahore 142, it was said that documents admitted on record withoutmaking endorsement prescribed by Rules cannot be regarded as having been brought on record,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/61legally, before Court.141. In Feroze Din and Ors. vs. Nawab Khan and others, AIR 1928 Lahore 432, Court said thatdocuments should not be endorsed until they are proved. Sometimes Court may mark a documentas an exhibit without having it proved.142. In Sait Tarajee Khimchand and others vs Yelamarti Satyam alias Satteyya and others, AIR 1971SC 1865, Court said that merely marking of an exhibit does not dispense with the proof ofdocuments. It was followed in Sitaram vs. Ram Charan and Ors. AIR 1995 MP 134.143. There are some exceptions. Where document was duly proved before a Commissionerappointed to take evidence and endorsed by him and it became part of record though Trial Court didnot endorse it as required by it under Order 13 Rule 4, but for such document in Ma Fatima andothers vs. Momin Bibi and others, AIR 1929 Rangoon 211, it was held that such a document wouldbe admissible in evidence and cannot be rejected for mere failure of Trial Court to endorse asexhibit.144. This Court also in Bal Mukandji Maharaj vs. Gokaran Singh and another, AIR 1956 All 124observed that a document tendered in evidence which was also admitted by other side withoutobjection should not be excluded merely because no exhibit mark was given to it.145. In one matter, photocopies were filed and their admission in evidence was not objected by otherside. Court said that any subsequent objection to admissibility of such document cannot be allowedin appeal. In R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder vs. Arulmigu Viswesaraswami and V.P. Temple andanother, 2003(8) SCC 752, Court said:"The objections as to admissibility of documents in evidence may be classified into two classes:- (i)an objection that the document which is sought to be proved is itself inadmissible in evidence; and(ii) where the objection does not dispute the admissibility of the document in evidence but isdirected towards the mode of proof alleging the same to be irregular or insufficient. In the first case,merely because a document has been marked as 'an exhibit', an objection as to its admissibility isnot excluded and is available to be raised even at a later stage or even in appeal or revision. In thelatter case, the objection should be taken before the evidence is tendered and once the document hasbeen admitted in evidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection that it should not have beenadmitted in evidence or that the mode adopted for proving the document is irregular cannot beallowed to be raised at any stage subsequent to the marking of the document as an exhibit. The laterproposition is a rule of fair play. The crucial test is whether an objection, if taken at the appropriatepoint of time, would have enabled the party tendering the evidence to cure the defect and resort tosuch mode of proof as would be regular. The omission to object becomes fatal because by his failurethe party entitled to object allows the party tendering the evidence to act on an assumption that theopposite party is not serious about the made of proof. On the other hand, a prompt objection doesnot prejudice the party tendering the evidence, for two reasons; firstly, it enables the Court to applyits mind and pronounce its decision on the question of admissibility then and there; and secondly,in the event of finding of the Court on the mode of proof sought to be adopted going against theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/62party tendering the evidence the opportunity of seeking indulgence of the Court for permitting aregular mode or method of proof and thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, isavailable to the party leading the evidence. Such practice and procedure is fair to both the parties.Out of the two types of objections, referred to hereinabove in the later case, failure to raise a promptand timely objection amounts to waiver of the necessity for insisting on formal proof of a document,the document itself which is sought to be proved being admissible in evidence. In the first case,acquiescence would be no bar to raising the objection in superior Court." (emphasis added)146. The above view has been followed and reiterated in Shalimar Chemical Works Ltd. vs. SurendraOil and Dal Mills (Refineries) and others, 2010(8) SCC 423.147. Construing Order 13 Rule 4 CPC in R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder (supra), Court also observed:"Order 13 Rule 4 of the CPC provides for every document admitted in evidence in the suit beingendorsed by or on behalf of the Court, which endorsement signed or initialed by the Judge amountsto admission of the document in evidence. An objection to the admissibility of the document shouldbe raised before such endorsement is made and the Court is obliged to form its opinion on thequestion of admissibility and express the same on which opinion would depend the document beingendorsed as admitted or not admitted in evidence. In the latter case, the document may be returnedby the Court to the person from whose custody it was produced." (emphasis added)148. It also expressed its agreement with the decision in Roman Catholic Mission v. The State ofMadras and another 1966(3) SCR 283, taking a view that a document, not admissible in evidencethough brought on record, has to be excluded from consideration. The above decision has beenreferred to recently in Nandkishore Lalbhai Mehta vs. New Era Fabrics Pvt. Ltd. and others, 2015SCC (9) 755.149. In R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder (supra) and Shalimar Chemical Works Ltd. (supra)photocopies/xerox copies were relied and admitted in evidence. Since not objected by other sidebefore Trial Court, Court did not allow an objection regarding admissibility of such documents asevidence in subsequent proceedings in appeal before Superior Court.150. These rules of procedure, as already said, should be followed strictly though not in a manner soas to cause any injustice to either of party and sometimes variation therein may not affect ultimateresult in rendering the judgment illegal or bad in law, provided facts in that case show that noprejudice has caused to other side as appropriate opportunity for objection was not taken. Suchinstances should not be a rule but an exception. In general practice, an honest and seriousobservance of requirement of rules is expected to be followed and Trial Court should proceed in thematter, accordingly.151. Having a retrospect of relevant statutory provisions, judicial precedents, practice and procedureof marking the documents as Exhibits, we are constrained to observe that Court below in the case inhand, has proceeded in a wholly irregular manner by not following various provisions relating toadmission of evidence and marking of such documents as are proved and admitted in evidence,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/63"exhibits". The documents have not been processed as provided in various statutory provisions asdiscussed above. Had it been a case of one or two documents, indeliberate mistake on the part ofCourt below could have presumed, but a wholesale defiance to the said procedure leads us to inferthat Court below was ignorant of such procedure.152. We find it strange that Presiding Officer(s) of Trial Court is/are not well conversant with themanner and procedure in which a document must be admitted and accepted in evidence. It isdifficult to conceive that a judicial officer can proceed in such a reckless and careless manner. Eithersuch an officer can be termed as wholly ignorant of relevant statutory procedural provisions, dealingwith the manner in which a suit has to be decided or one is extremely careless not to pay attention tothese statutory and mandatory provisions. We are constrained to make above observation for thereason that recently in a large number of appeals, we have come across, similar flaw has beennoticed. It gives an impression that either officers in Subordinate Courts are not being given propertraining or there is something otherwise wrong on their part in not adhering to the Rules andprocedure with respect to admission and marking of documents as exhibits, so as to render the samevalid piece of evidence. Let our observations be communicated to all subordinate Courts.153. At this stage, we may also refer to some of the authorities heavily relied by Sri Manish Goel,learned counsel for appellant, in support of his submission that the judgment and decree is vitiatedin law as the evidence relied was not validly admitted in accordance with procedure prescribed inthe Rules.154. Sri Manish Goel argued that photographs without negative and paper cuttings wereinadmissible evidence and Court below relying thereon has erred in law and these findings are basedon documents, inadmissible in evidence and to that extent findings are based on no evidence at all.He placed reliance on Samant N. Balkrishna and another vs. George Fernandez and others, 1969(3)SCC 238; Laxmi Raj Shetty and another vs. State of Tamil Nadu, 1988(3) SCC 319; and, QuamarulIslam vs. S.K. Kanta and others, 1994 Supp.(3) SCC 5.155. Dispute in Samant N. Balkrishna and another vs. George Fernandez and others (supra) hasarisen from an election petition wherein Sri George Fernandez was declared elected from BombaySouth Parliamentary Constituency of Lok Sabha in the elections held in February, 1967 which waschallenged by Samant N. Balkrishna, an elector in the Constituency on various grounds includingallegations of corrupt practice. Election petition was dismissed by High Court and that is how thematter reached Supreme Court. Therein certain allegations of false publication of a news item in'Maratha' was pleaded in election petition so as to constitute corrupt practice on the part of returnedcandidate through its agent but a direct allegation of corrupt practice against returned candidatewas sought to be added which was not approved by Supreme Court. In para 47 of the judgment, inthe context of news item published in newspaper 'Maratha', Court observed as under:"A news item without any further proof of what had actually happened through witnesses is of novalue. It is at best a secondhand secondary evidence. It is well-known that reporters collectinformation and pass if on to the editor who edits the news item and then publishes it. In thisprocess the truth might get perverted or garbled. Such news items cannot be said to proveSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/64themselves although they may be taken into account with other evidence if the other evidence isforcible." (emphasis added)156. Court also observed that trial of an election petition is made in accordance with Code of CivilProcedure but a corrupt practice must be proved in the same way as a criminal charge is proved. Anelection petitioner must exclude every hypothesis except that of guilt on the part of returnedcandidate or his election agent. When a corrupt practice is alleged against a returned candidatethrough his agent, consent of returned candidate has to be proved or election petitioner must gofurther and prove that the result of election in so far as returned candidate is concerned, wasmaterially affected. In para 48 of judgment, Court said that a newspaper reporting a meeting, doesso as part of its own activity, and there can be no inference of consent. What was necessary, had tobe pleaded and proved, that Mr. Fernandez said this and this. Newspaper reports could be taken insupport but not independently. Here the plea was not taken at all and evidence was not direct butindirect. We do not find the aforesaid judgment to be of any assistance to learned counsel forappellant particularly when it has been rendered in the context of specific requirement of electionlaws as is pointed out by Court in para 33 of judgment, which reads as under:"33. To begin with it must be realised that as is stated in Jagan Nath v. Jaswant Singh and others,1954 SCR 892-895 the statutory requirements of the law of Election in India must be strictlyobserved. It is pointed out in that case that an election contest is not an action at law or a suit inequity but a purely statutory proceeding unknown to common law and that the Court possesses nocommon law power. Although the power of amendment given in the Code of Civil Procedure can beinvoked because Section 87 makes the procedure applicable, as nearly as may be to the trial ofelection petitions, the Representation of the People Act itself enacts some rules, which override theCivil Procedure Code. General power of amendment or the power derived from the Code of CivilProcedure must be taken to be overborne in so far as the election law provides. In a large number ofcases it has been laid down by the High Courts in India that the material facts, must make out acharge and it is only then that an amendment to amplify the charge can be allowed or new instancesof commission of corrupt practice charged can be given. If no charge is made out in the, petition atall the addition of particulars cannot be allowed to include indirectly a new charge." (emphasisadded)157. Court also referred to specific requirement of pleadings in statute pertaining to election,available in India, so as not to go by the otherwise law applicable in other matters.158. Laxmi Raj Shetty and another vs. State of Tamil Nadu (supra) was a decision rendered, arisingfrom a trial and conviction under Section 302 IPC and award of sentence of life imprisonment toconvict. Sri Manish Goel, learned counsel for appellant relied on paras 20, 25 and 26 of thejudgment. In an incident of robbery and murder of Manager of a Bank appellant, Laxmi Raj Shettywas convicted under Section 302 IPC with death sentence by Trial Court and under Sections 392and 449 IPC imprisonment for seven years each. High Court confirmed death sentence and othersentence under Section 302, 392, 449 IPC and matter went in appeal to Supreme Court. There wasno direct evidence in the matter and conviction and sentence founded on circumstantial evidence.Reliance on newspaper reports was placed by convict which was objected by State contending thatSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/65unauthenticated news items in press cannot be treated to be a credible evidence for either convictingor acquitting a person in a Court of Law. Accepting argument of State, Court said that in cases whereevidence is purely of circumstantial nature, facts and circumstances from which conclusion of guiltis sought to be drawn must be fully established beyond any reasonable doubt and circumstances soestablished should not only be consistent with the guilt of accused but they must in their effect besuch as to be entirely incompatible with innocence of accused and must exclude a reasonablehypothesis with his innocence. In para 20 of the judgment, Court said:"It is therefore well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature, thecircumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first intance be fullyestablished, and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guiltof the accused. Again, the circumstances should be of a conclusive nature and tendency and theyshould be such as to exclude every hypothesis but the one proposed to be proved. In other words,there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for aconclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that withinall human probability the act must have been done by the accused."159. Rejecting argument advanced on behalf of convict relying on newspaper reports, in para 25 ofjudgment, Court said:"We cannot take judicial notice of the facts stated in a news item being in the nature of hearsaysecondary evidence, unless proved by evidence aliunde. A report in a newspapers is only hearsayevidence. A newspaper is not one of the documents referred to in Section 78(2) of the Evidence Act,1872 by which an allegation of fact can be proved. The presumption of genuineness attached underSection 81 of the Evidence Act to a newspapers report cannot be treated as proved of the factsreported therein."(emphasis added)160. Further in para 26 of judgment, Court said:"26. It is now well-settled that a statement of fact contained in a newspapers is merely hearsay andtherefore inadmissible in evidence in the absence of the maker of the statement appearing in Courtand deposing to have perceived the fact reported. The accused should have therefore produced thepersons in whose presence the seizure of the stolen money from appellant no. 2's house atMangalore was effected or examined the press correspondents in proof of the truth of the contentsof the news item. The question as to the admissibility of newspaper reports has been dealt with bythis Court in Samant N. Balakrishna v. George Fernandez & Ors., [1969] 3 SCR 603. There thequestion arose whether Shri George Fernandez, the successful candidate returned to Parliamentfrom the Bombay South Parliamentary Constituency had delivered a speech at Shivaji Parkattributed to him as reported in the Maratha, a widely circulated Marathi newspaper in Bombay,and it was said:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/66"A newspaper report without any further proof of what had actually happened through witnesses isof no value. It is at best a second-hand secondary evidence. It is well known that reporters collectinformation and pass it on to the editor who edits the news item and then publishes it. In thisprocess the truth might get perverted or garbled. Such news items cannot be said to provethemselves although they may be taken into account with other evidence if the other evidence isforcible."We need not burden the judgment with many citations. There is nothing on record to substantiatethe facts as reported in the newspapers showing recovery of the stolen amount from the residence ofappellant no. 2 at Mangalore. We have therefore no reason to discard the testimony of PW 50 andthe seizure witnesses which go to establish that the amount in question was actually recovered atMadras on the 29th and the 30th as alleged."(emphasis added)161. The third decision relied by Sri Geol is Quamarul Islam vs. S.K. Kanta (supra). It is again adispute arising from an election petition under R.P. Act, 1951. Election of Quamarul Islam from 10Gulbarga Assembly Constituency held in September, 1992 was challenged on the ground of corruptpractices. Reliance was placed on speeches allegedly made by returned candidate published incertain news papers. In para 48 of judgment Court said:"48. Newspaper reports by themselves are not evidence of the contents thereof. Those reports areonly hearsay evidence. These have to be proved and the manner of proving a newspaper report iswell settled. Since, in this case, neither the reporter who heard the speech and sent the report wasexamined nor even his reports produced, the production of the newspaper by the Editor andpublisher, PW4 by itself cannot amount to proving the contents of the newspaper reports.Newspaper, is at the best secondary evidence of its contents and is not admissible in evidencewithout proper proof of the contents under the Indian Evidence Act. The learned trial judge couldnot treat the newspaper reports as duly 'proved' only by the production of the copies of thenewspaper. The election petitioner also examined Abrar Razi, PW5, who was the polling agent of theelection petitioner and resident of the locality in support of the correctness of the reports includingadvertisements and messages as published in the said newspaper. We have carefully perused histestimony and find that his evidence also falls short of proving the contents of the reports of thealleged speeches or the messages and the advertisements, which appeared in different issues of thenewspaper. Since, the maker of the report which formed basis of the publications, did not appear inthe Court to depose about the facts as perceived by him, the facts contained in the published reportswere clearly inadmissible. No evidence was led by the election petitioner to prove the contents of themessages and the advertisements as the original manuscript of the advertisements or the messageswas not produced at the trial. No witness came forward to prove the receipt of the manuscript of anyof the advertisements or the messages or the publication of the came in accordance with themanuscript. There is no satisfactory and reliable evidence on the record to even establish that thesame were actually issued by IUML or MYL, ignoring for the time being, whether or not theappellant had any connection with IUML or MYL or that the same were published by him or with hisconsent by any other person or published by his election agent or by any other person with theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/67consent of his election agent. The evidence of the election petitioner himself or of PW4 and PW5 toprove the contents of the messages and advertisements in the newspaper in our opinion waswrongly admitted and relied upon as evidence of the contents of the statement contained therein."(emphasis added)162. Aforesaid decisions, as we have already discussed, were rendered in the facts and circumstancesof each case and also on provisions of Evidence Act and in the light of discussions made above wefind that these authorities do not help the appellant. Moreover, findings of Court below on the issuesof installation of parties in the office of Sankaracharya, as claimed, are not solely founded onnewspapers and photographs and moreso parties have not even denied those documents beforeCourt below. Now for the first time this objection is being raised before this Court in appeal, hencein view of discussion made above, we do not find it justified to reject documents, relied by Courtbelow, by holding the same inadmissible in evidence since not marked 'exhibit', when no suchobjection was taken before Court below and evidence in the form of paper number has been reliedby both sides.163. Any otherwise view would have required us not to proceed in the matter further and send thematter back to Court below for re-trial after admitting documents in accordance with procedureprescribed in law, but since, in the present case, neither parties have taken any objection in Courtbelow during trial and on the contrary have relied on the all the documents in one or the other way,following dictum in R.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder (supra) and Shalimar Chemical Works Ltd.(supra), we do not find it appropriate to allow appellant to raise this objection for the first time atappellate stage. When both the parties prosecuted the matter in Court below on the basis of thesedocuments treating same as admissible evidence, taking into account paper numbers, in the absenceof any objection on their part in Court below, we find it justified to treat it admission on the part ofrespective parties and, therefore, all documents are held admissible in evidence and deserve to bemarked 'exhibits', if not already marked.164. Even otherwise, we find this objection, hyper technical, and an attempt to take an advantage atappellate stage when defendant has lost the matter before Trial Court, pleading a failure on the partof Trial Court in marking documents, Exhibits, though both parties, through their witnesses, haveproved various documents filed by them in various ways. Strictly speaking, it may be said that someor all the documents have not been properly proved but still, fact remains, that witnesses of bothsides have proved documents in their depositions. They have also been cross examined on suchstatements proving documents. Regarding admissibility of documents as evidence, no objection,whatsoever, has been taken at all. The endeavor on the part of both parties to prove their documentsthrough their witnesses, we may elaborate, not in entirety, but to some extent so as to fortify ourfindings in this regard.165. In order to prove various photographs, on behalf of plaintiff, PW-36, Kamla Pati Tiwari, aphotographer; and, PW-37, Satya Narain, a photographer and videographer, have been examined.Similarly on behalf of appellant, DW-40, Ram Niranjan Singh, a photographer, has been examined.Most witnesses were produced by both parties in support of fact that installation of respectiveSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/68parties actually took place as Shankaracharya on dates, they claimed, and to prove it, variousAbhinandan Patras, Registers and other documents were produced. To prove those documents,most witnesses have been adduced by both sides.166. Some of the documents proved by plaintiff's witnesses are referred as under:(i) PW 2 proved papers no.

In this backdrop, we find no such substantial irregularity in the case in hand which may renderthe judgment vitiated in law for non marking of documents as "exhibits", and, hence, we rejectobjection of Sri Manish Goel in this regard. We have already passed orders in this regard directingRegistry to mark documents as 'exhibits' in the presence of counsel for parties during hearing of thecase subject to final result. We are giving our reasons hereat and thus have dealt with this aspect ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/71the matter. The documents have been marked as 'exhibits'. We would refer documents, both, bypaper number as well as exhibit number.Points for Determination and Adjudication:169. Now we proceed to consider points for determination as have arisen on rival submissions andproceed to adjudicate the same.170. The first point for determination is, position of "Shankaracharya, his antiquity, his philosophy,work carried out by him for propagating Sanatan Dharma, his influence over followers of SanatanDharma and position and status of Shankaracharya and his Peethas vis a vis the persons occupyingthose Peethas in the eyes of Hindu followers of Adi Shankaracharya's philosophy".171. Second point for determination which we propose to discuss simultaneously is, "whether forinstallation of any person to head the Peethas established by Adi Guru Shankaracharya, are thereany set of discipline, Rules and Regulations"?172. Incidental to the aforesaid question, Third Point for determination would be, "whetherMathamnaya and Mahanushasan are written work containing and prescribing Regulations layingdown mode, manner, eligibility and other instructions for selection and installation of anappropriate person to Head the said Peethas".About Adi Shankaracharya(a) Origin173. In regard to origin of Adi Shankaracharya and his antiquity there are two views and differencegoes to the extent of about 1200 years. One view takes us back to 476 B.C. to 507 B.C and other viewrelates his origin to 680 A.D. to 788 A.D. With regard to his place of birth and parents there is nonoticeable difference. Interestingly, so far as this Court is concerned, both the parties agree to thehistory, accepting origin of Adi Shankaracharya, in and around, 500 B.C.174. Historical work of one "Pt. Harikrishna Raturi" Former Minister of Tehri (Princely State), titledas "Garhwal ka Itihas" published in 1928 by Garhwali Press, Dehradun, second edition published in1980 by Bhagirathi Prakashan Grih, Suman Chauk, Tehri, relied by appellant and not disputed byplaintiff, may be referred hereat. In Chapter 15 pages (128-131) learned author has given descriptionof corresponding social deformities when Adi Shankaracharya was born and has illuminated greatwork done by him. Some relevant extracts thereof read as under:"^blh izdkj tc ifo= cq) /keZ esa Hkh le; le; ds vkpk;ksZa ds cqf) okn vFkok foykflrk cqf) ls vusd erHksn gksrs pys x;s] lc ls izFke pkj er i`Fkd~ i`Fkd~ ckS)ksa ds chp gq;s ftlls mudh pkj 'kk[kkfofHkUu erokn fy;s cu xbZA buds pkj fl)kUr okfn pkj 'kk[kk ,d dk uke oSHkkfod] nwljh dk ukeek/;fed] rhljh dk uke ;ksxkpj vkSj pkSFkh dk uke lkS=kfU=d FkkA budh pkj 'kk[kkvksa ds pkj nyHkh i`Fkd~ i`Fkd cu pqds FksA"Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/72"Likewise, when differences resulted in pious Budhism, on account of intellectualism/rationalismand lustful approach of Acharyas of various period, first of all, four different philosophies ofBudhism emerged among Budhists, as a result whereof, four streams came into existence withdifferent intellectualism.

There had been two Kalidasas, who was one ofnine jewels in the Court of Maharaj Vikram and thereafter, the other who was the jewel in the Courtof Maharaj Bhoj. Thus, it is not known by whom "Shankar Ka Digvijay" was written, whether bysubsequent Kalidas or earlier Kalidas. But so far as, it appears, it should have been written by laterKalidas who was a jewel in the Court of King Bhoj of Dhar, who was the son of Munj's brother,because period of King Bhoj of Dhar is considered to be between 1010-1053 AD.cMkSnk jkT; ds nQ~rj esa tks dkxt i= feys gSa muls fofnr gksrk gS fd 'kadjkpk;Z ;qf/kf"Bj 'kd 2631Â¼bZlk ls 476 o"kZ iwoZÂ½ esa gq;sA 2636 ;qf/kf"Bj 'kd dh pS= d`".k f}rh;k dks mudk miu;u gqvkFkkA dkfrZdonh ,dkn'kh dks ;qf/kf"Bj 'kd 2639 dks vkB o"kZ dh vk;q esa os lU;klh gq;s Fks] nwljslky egkjkt xksfoUnkpk;Z ls HksaV gqbZ FkhA 33 o"kZ dh vk;q esa ;qf/kf"Bj 'kd 2663 dkfrZd dhvekoL;k dks mudk nsgkUr gqvkA iwoksZDr fl)kUr dh iqf"V }kfjdk eB ls feys ys[kksa ls Hkh gksrh gSijUrq iqjkrRo osRrkvksa dk fo'okl bu dkxt i=ksa ij Hkh ughaA ,sfrgkfld izek.kksa ls os 'kadjkpk;Z dkgksuk vkBoha 'krkCnh esa fl) djrs gSa] ijUrq iw.kZ :i ls os fl) ugha dj ldrsA From the documentsdiscovered from the Office of Baroda Estate, it appears that Shankaracharya emerged in YudhisthirShaka 2631 (476 B.C.).

At the age of 8 years, Ekadashi, Kartik Vadi, Yudhisthir Shaka 2639, hebecame Sanyasi, next year came in touch with Govindacharya. At the age of 33 years on KartikAmavasya, Yudhisthir Shaka 2663 he left for heavenly abode. The aforesaid finding is supported byarticles found from Dwarika Math but the archaeologists do not believe these documents as well. Byhistorical evidences, they try to prove the period of Shankaracharya in 8th century but but cannotprove wholly. (English Translation by Court)176. The said author has also discussed about period of death of Adi Shankaracharya and differenceamong historians on this aspect, as under:,sls gh 'kadjkpk;Z dh e`R;q ds fo"k; esa Hksn ik;k tkrk gS] gaVj dh rkjh[k esa 32 o"kZ dh voLFkk esaÂ¼tSlk fd ,d xzUFk esa fy[kk gSÂ½ mRrj fgeky; dsnkjukFk esa 'kadjkpk;Z dk nsgkUr gksuk fy[kk gSAvke yksxksa dk dFku gS fd 33 o"kZ dh voLFkk esa Â¼tSlk fd cMkSnk ds nQ~rj ds dkxtksa esa fy[kkgSÂ½ d'ehj ns'k esa 'kadjkpk;Z dk nsgkolku gqvk FkkA ;g ekywe ugha fd dkSu lh ckr lR; gSASimilarly, there are differences in opinion about the death of Shankaracharya.

Similarly in "Amit Kal Rekha", a research work of Sri Parmeshwar Nath Mishra, Advocatepublished by Shankaracharya Parampara Evam Sanskrit Rakshak Parishad, Vrindavan Complex,Aruna Apartment, 4, Station Road, Liliua, Howrah, First Edition, June 2001, antiquity of AdiShankaracharya has been traced to 507 B.C. According to the aforesaid research work, AdiShankaracharya was born on Baishakh Shukla Panchami, Shak Samvat 2631 corresponding to 507B.C. in Village Kaladi, District Ernukuram (now in State of Kerala) and left this world in YudhisthirShak Samvat 2663 corresponding to 475 B.C.178. In Brahma Sutra Bhashya, said to have been authored by Adi Shankaracharya, there is areference of two big cities namely, Strughn and Patliputra. The relevant "Bhrahma Sutra Bhashya"reads as under:-^^ufg nsonRr% lzq?us lafu/kh; ekuLrngjso ikVfyiq=sÂ·fi lafu/kh;rs ;qxinusd= o`RrkousdRo izlax%L;kr~ nsonRr ;KnRr;ksfjo lzq?u ikVfyiq= fuokfluks%A**"vFkkZr~& lzq?u esa orZeku nsonRr mlh fnu ikVfyiq= esa orZeku ugha jgrk gS vkSj ,d dky esa vusdrUrq esa iV ds jgus ij vusd iV dh izlfDr gS] tSls fd lzq?u vkSj ikVfyiq= ds fuoklh nsonRr o ;KnRr esavusdrk jgrh gSA "Present Devdutt cannot reside in Srughna and Patliputra the same day and like acloth containing different threads reflects diversity in unity, in the same way, there is diversitybetween Devdutt and Yagyadutt, the residents of Srughna and Patliputra".^^;ksfi lzq?ukUeFkqjka xRok eFkqjk;k% ikVfyiq=a oztfr lksfi lzq?ukRikVfyiq=a ;krhfr 'kD;rsofnrqe~A rLekr~ ^izk.kLrstlh*fr izk.klai`DrL;k/;{kL;SoSrRrst% lgpfjrs"kq Hkwrs"ooLFkkue~A**vFkkZr~& tks Hkh lzq?u ls eFkqjk tkdj eFkqjk ls ikVfyiq= tkrk gS og Hkh lzq?u ls ikVfyiq= tkrk gS,slk dgk tk ldrk gSA blfy;s ^izk.kLrstfl* blls izk.k lEc) tho dk Hkh rst lgpfjr Hkwrksa esa ;g voLFkkugSA "Whosoever having visited Mathura from Srughna and goes to Patliputra, it may be called sothat he goes from Srughna to Patliputra. Therefore, 'Pranastejasi', i.e, the status of living creature,also is the same as of other similar creatures having radiance." (English translation by Court)179. Patliputra was a very well developed city as referred by Chinese Traveler "Fahien" in his travelsaccount, who is said to have visited India in 400-411 A.D. It is said that Pushppur was the capital ofAshoka and city has his palace and conference house. It was the biggest city of Madhya Desh. Theresidents were rich. Another Chinese foreign traveler "Hwen Ts'ang" came to India in 630-644 A.D.and mentioned that during his visit, Kusumpur or Patlipurta cities were virtually non-existent andonly some walls were found. The reminiscence of city of Ashoka were spread in an perimeter of 14miles, meaning thereby that Patliputra was already extinct before 630 AD. If that is so, period of AdiShankaracharya could not be the period of 788-820 A.D., making a reference of Patliputra city inthe manner as aforesaid, since that city was virtually non existent at that time. It takes the period ofAdi Shankaracharya, in any case, much before 630 A.D. With regard to Strughan also, Chinesetraveler "Hwen Ts'ang" has written that it was on the western bank of Yamuna River in the area of20 Lie, but had destroyed long back.180. In order to point out origin of Adi Shankaracharya in 400-500 BC, a reference is made to thecommentary of Adi Shankaracharya on "Mandukya Upanishad" 1.2 English Translation by "SwamiSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/76Gambhiranand" Published by Advait Ashram, Kolkata. Therein "Karshapana" has been mentionedas currency in use of his time, relevant portion of which reads as follows:"Self is possessed of four quarters, like a Karshapana, but not like a cow."181. According to "Cunningham", "Karshapana" coin was in use from 1000 BC while according toDr. A.S. Altekar, Dr. S.K. Chakroberty and Prof. Vasudev Upadhyay, at least from 800 BC. Duringarchaeological excavations, 'Karshapana' coins have been obtained in black polished earthen pots;and on the basis of Carbon 14 dating, those pots have been ascertained of about 600 BC. As such, itis needless to say that "Karshapana" coins kept in those pots are much older. In 'Ashtadhyayi'Panini, in 'Maha Bhashya' Patanjali, and in 'Kamasutra' Vatsyayan have mentioned "Karshapana"coins as currency in use in their respective period.182. In Naneghat inscription of queen Nayanika, wife of King Satakarni, in Nasik inscription ofson-in-law of Shak Chhatrap Nahpan, and, in another Nasik inscription of Ishwarsen Abhir,'Karshapana' has been mentioned as currency in use. According to Dr. Bhandarkar, date of saidinscription of Ishwarsen Abhir is Shak Era 119 corresponding to 197 AD. This is the last SouthIndian inscription in which 'Karshapana' has been mentioned as currency in use and after that notin a single inscription of South Indian kings Karshapana currency has been mentioned.183. So far as North India is concerned, in the inscriptions from the period of Emperor Ashoka i.e.3rd BC to inscriptions of King Vishnugupta of 6th AD, not in a single inscription, "Karshapana" hasbeen mentioned. Instead, "Karshapana", in those inscriptions- 'Hiranya', 'Puran', 'Suvarn' and'Dinar' coins have been mentioned as currency in use. In Damodarpur [III] Copper plate inscriptionof Gupta Era 163 equivalent to 482 AD, 'Hiranya' and 'Dinar' have been mentioned as synonyms ofeach other. According to Archaeologist Dr. Ramsharan Sharma, there is not a single inscription of6th AD to 12th AD, wherein 'Karshapana' has been mentioned.184. Professor Vasudev Upadhyaya and Dr. Parmeshwarilal Gupta are unanimous in concludingthat in Northern India, till 2nd BC, and in Southern India, till 2nd AD, "Karshapana" were seldom inuse whereafter use of "Karshapana" was totally stopped.185. Dr. Vashudev Upadhyay concludes that "Karshapna" was in use in all over India prior toMauryas' reign i.e. 4th BC. As such, Adi Shankaracharya who used 'Karshapana' in his Commentaryto make the true purport of Sacred Text easily understandable for the people of entire India, wascertainly present in the 5th BC. Advent of Adi Shankaracharya cannot be imagined in 788 AD asduring that period 'Karshpana' coins were not in use.186. The antiquity of Shankaracharya has also been related by Pt. Harikrishna Raturi with referenceto Temple of Sri Badrinath. In his Book 'Garhwal ka Itihas' (supra), he has written that according toan inscription of Badarinath Temple, said Temple was built by Shankaracharya 2380 years back,(452 B.C.), though mentioned in the book as (Vikrami Samvat 76). We find here that in calculation,writer has committed an error of a few years which transpired from his own statement contained inthe said book to the effect that according to the documents preserved in the records of Baroda StateSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/77it is known that Adi Shankaracharya was born in Yudhisthir Shak 2631 corresponding to 476 BC. Infact Yudhisthir Shak 2631 is equvalent to 507 BC as such there is 31 years shortage in its conversionby Sri Raturi. We get 492 BC as the real date of construction of aforesaid Temple which matcheswith old records or traditions of 'Peeth' established by Adi Shankaracharya. Four Copper plateInscriptions procured from Pandukeshwar Temple, management whereof was under BadarinathTemple, substantiate antiquity of said temple as those inscriptions are certificate of land granted byKings of the Kushali Dynasty in Vardhaman Vijairaj Samvatsar 4, 21, 22 and 25 respectively infavour of Badarinath Temple. Those inscriptions are in antique Pali, which was prevalent from4thBC to 5thAD. In the inscription of "Subhiksharaj Kushali" bearing Vardhaman Vijairaj Samvatsar4, his father has been projected more benevolent than 'Shesh' 'Bali', 'Vaikartan' [Karna], 'Dadhichi'and 'Chandragupta'. In the said history it has been stated that Rajpal, King of that region wasdescendent of 'Parikshit' and contemporary of king 'Vikramaditya' of Ujjain, the founder of VikaramSamvat and after his dynasty, region was ruled over by kings of 'Panwar Dynasty'. It shows thatKushali dynasty ruled that area some times between 3rd BC and 1st BC.187. However, in "The Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trust", written by AC Sen, 5thEdition, learned author dates back antiquity of Adi Shankarcharya to 700 or 600 AD. Most recentResearchers and Authors have also accepted period of Adi Shankaracharya in 600-700 AD andsome have referred to his period of birth from 688 AD or 788 AD. With regard to his death, all areagreeable that he lived for 32 years and died at an early age.188. The relevancy to find out origin of Adi Shankaracharya is to understand content and meaningof various aspects propagated and defined by him, in the light of scriptures prevalent at that time,but we find ourselves short of expert in this regard to give a final opinion in the presence of differentversions. Be that as it may, we are not proposing to record any final opinion with regard to antiquityof Adi Shankaracharya since for our purposes, factum of his work i.e. establishment of Peethas anddirections issued by him with regard to continuous management thereof would be relevant andtherefore, we are confining ourselves to this aspect only.(b) Works and stature/position among Sanatan Dharma followers/devotees.189. It is a common case that Adi Shankaracharya established four Peethas to protect, preserve andpropagate knowledge of Supreme Self (Bahm) i.e. Vidya and facilitate people to move from 'Avidya'(worldly knowledge) to 'Vidya' and thereby attain salvation. As such to interpret the purport of thesaid greatest Preceptor, it is necessary to know about the tradition of Vedas.190. Elaborating on the stature of Adi Shankaracharya for Hindu Santan Dharma followers anddevotees, both the parties are ad idem that Adi Shankaracharya was a 'Vibhuti' or 'Mahima', i.e."Divine Majesty (glory). In ordinary sense, it may also be termed as 'Daiviya Padavi', i.e. 'Divinestatus', 'position'.191. Sri Padmacharya, one of four principal disciples of Adi Shankaracharya, and first Acharya andJagat Guru Shankaracharya of Goverdhanmath Puri, in "Panch Padiaka" has said that rLeknxz.kh%f'k"Vkpkjifjikyus Hkxoku~ Hkk";dkj%A (amongst men of righteous conduct of Lord ShankaracharyaSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/78Interpreter is foremost). In the tradition of non-dualistic denomination, Adi Shankaracharya isoften referred and called as "Bhagvatpad" and "Bhagwan Bhashyakar". One who possesses sixattributes namely lordliness, prowess, fame, beauty, knowledge, non-attachment is Bhagwan or onewho knows the origin, dissolution, the bondage and salvation of creatures, knowledge, ignorance is"Bhagwan". As all these attributes and knowledge were possessed by Adi Shankaracharya, he iscalled "Bhagwan".192. Whom people call 'Bhagwan'? In "Srimadbhagwatgita" Arjun first asked Lord Krishna to tellhim, his, Divya Vibhutinam i.e., Divine Glories:oDrqegZL;'ks"kss.k fnO;k g~;kRefoHkwr;% A ;kfHkfoZHkwfrfHkyksZdkfuekaLRoa O;kI; fr"BflAA16AA "So you alone are capable of enlightening me well on your glories by which you pervade anddwell in all the worlds."

(Hindi and English translation by Court)194. And then Lord said that 'among the Gods, I am Indra, among the Rudras, I am Shankar, amongthe men, I am King, among the wielders of weapons, I am Rama, among rishis, I am Vasudeo, andamong Muni, I am Vyasa I am 'Adnhyatmvidya' i.e. knowledge of the Self.195.

That means the cause of their birth is a component of my radiance, thus youshould know." (Hindi and English translation by Court)197. Renowned ascetic and non-ascetic scholars in their respective translation of above mentionedcouplets of Srimadbhagwatgita have translated Sanskrit word 'Divya Vibhuti' as 'Divine Glory''Divine Majesty'.198. Similarly, in "Mahabharata", Divine Glories of Lord Shiva have been enumerated as follows:"you assume the form of Indra, amongst Yogis you are Nishkal Shiv, amongst Rishis you areVashishtha, you are Bhagwan, Sarvajna (Omniscient), Nigrah (he who restrains and subjugates),Brahma, Shankar, Shankar-adhan (Shankar who has no wealth), Vishnu Mundi (shaven head) orDandi (who has the well known badge of renunciation viz the stick) Guru (great Lord or preceptor),Brahmadanda Vinirmata (maker of Brahman's rod), Brahmavid Brahman (who knows meanings ofVedas and devoted to Brahm i.e. Brahmajnani), Vyas.199. All the above scriptural glories of Lord Shiva are source of religious belief of ascetics anddevotees who follow religious path shown by Adi Shankaracharya, They treat Adi Shankaracharya asone of the 'Vibhutinam' (glories or majesties or manifestations) of 'Lord Shankar'.200. Traditional religious belief since last thousand and more years is also recorded in "ShankarDigvijaya". It records that 'Sage Vyasa' declared 'Adi Shankaracharya' unique incarnation of LordShiva.201. In brief, both the parties are in agreement on the stature/authority of "Adi Shankaracharya"that Adi Shankaracharya is a Divine Majesty i.e., "Daiviya Padvi" of an incarnation of Lord Shankarand it is not an office or post, as we understand these terms, in common parlance. In other words,"Adi Shankaracharya" is not like an ordinary Mahant or Mathadhipati but a living diety of aReligious Kshetra and his monastery is religious capital thereof, as centre of traditional knowledge,from which areas, he is authorized only to ask for alms and not wealth.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/80202. Now coming to installation on seats of learning for propagating Vedic tradition and teachingsof Upnishads, we find that 'Adi Shankaracharya" propagated philosophy of Advait. He had a veryshort span of life of 32 years. He became 'Renouncer' at the age of 8 years and, became proficient inVedas, its subsidiaries and all scriptures at the age of 12 years. He wrote commentaries on'Prasthana Trayee-Upanisads, Brahma-Sutra and Gita', authored so many original works, explainedmeaning of the "Vishnu Sahasranama" etc. at the age of 16 years.203. Acharya Shankar i.e. "Adi Shankaracharya", defeated several giant disputants indebate/discourse upon scriptures, foremost of whom was scholar Mimamsak (interpreter) ofritualistic school of Vedas, Sri "Mandan Mishra" and his learned wife 'Bharati'. After being defeated,"Mandan Mishra", who is considered to be an incarnation of Lord Brahma, became his disciple andrenamed by Adi Shankaracharya, as "Sureshwaracharya" alias 'Vishwaroop'.

Thus, to refer Shankaracharya as an "office" or "post" in our view is a misnomer andundermines position of Shankaracharya in the eyes of the customary laws being observed andfollowed by followers for more than a thousand years. The definition of ''office' is different andcannot be equated with the situation of installation of a Shankaracharya and authority he enjoys.207. The term ''Office' has been defined in Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, on page 1082-1083as under:Office:A right, and correspondent duty, to exercise a public trust. A public charge or employment. Anemployment on behalf of the government in any station or public trust, not merely transient,occasional, or incidental. The most frequent occasions to use the word arise with reference to a dutyand power conferred on an individual by the Government and, when this is the connection, "publicoffice" is a usual and more discriminating expression. But a power and duty may exist withoutimmediate grant from government, and may be properly called an "office," as the office of executor.Here the individual acts towards legatees in performance of a duty, and exercise of a power notderived from their consent, but devolved on him by an authority which quoad hoc is superior.An "assigned duty" or "function." Synonyms are "post", "appointment", "situation", "place","position", and "office" commonly suggests a position of (especially public) trust or authority. Alsoright to exercise a public function or employment, and to take the fees and emoluments belonging toit. A public charge of employment and he who perform the duties of the office is an officer. Althoughan office is an employment, it does not follow that every employment is an office. A man may beemployed under a contract, expressed or implied, to do an act, or to perform a service, withoutbecoming an officer. But, if the duty be a continuing one, which is defined by rules prescribed by thegovernment, which an individual is appointed by the government to perform, who enters upon theduties appertain to his status, without any contract defining them, it seems very difficult todistinguish such a charge or employment from an office, or the person who performs the duty froman officer. In the constitutional sense, the term implies an authority to exercise some portion of thesovereign power either in making, executing, or administrating the laws.208. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, Seventh Edition, Volume 2, defines 'Office'on page 1846 as under:Office:An office is "a right to exercise a public or private employment and to take the fees and emolumentsthereunto belonging" (2 BL. Com. 36; see further 3 Cru. Dig. Title, 25).".. an office necessarily implies that there is some duty to be performed" (per Cockburn C.J., Heartlyv Banks, 5 C.B.N.S. 55).Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/85"Office" was held to be an apt word to describe the position of a trustee, or any position in whichservices are due by the holder and in which the holder has no employer (Dale v I.R.C. [1954]A.C. 11).209. P. Ramanatha Aiyar's 'The Law Lexicon' 3rd Edition 2012 defines 'Office' on page 1245-1246 asunder:Office:That function by virtue thereof a man hath some employment in the affairs of another, as of theKing, or of another person. (Cowell; Tomlin) An office is 'the right to exercise a public or privateemployment, and take the fees and emoluments there unto belonging, whether public, as those ofmagistrates, or private, as of bailiffs, receivers, etc. (Bl. Com.) The term "office" denotes a duty in theholder to be discharged by him as such. It consists in a right and correspondent duty, to execute apublic of private duty and to take the emoluments belonging to it. (9 MLT 355.) Webster defines anoffice to be the place where a particular kind of business or service for others is transacted; a houseor apartment in which public officers and others transact business; as a registrar's office, a lawyer'soffice. "Office" includes place and employment; Govt. of India Act (9 & 10 Geo. V Ch. 101), S. 134, Cl.5.] The word 'office' has two meanings: the one popular, the other legal and technical. Thus we speakof the office of an executor, guardian &c. The legal meaning of the term always implies a charge, ortrust, conferred by public authority, and for a public purpose. (Ame. Cyc.) An office is in this sense, atrust created for the public. It imports a duty or trust.A common division of offices is into judicial and ministerial. It is laid down that the former cannotbe exercised by deputy unless there be express authority. Nor could they be assigned or granted for aterm of years (Reynel's Case, 9 Rep. 95:77 ER 871) or in reversion. The same officer may be called toperform both judicial and ministerial acts, an will be civilly liable for neglect or failure to performthe ministerial but not the judicial acts. (Ferguson v Kinnoull, 1842, 9 Cl & Fin. 251:4 St. Tri. N.S.785: 8 ER 412; Ency, of the Laws of England.) An office may be classed into civil and military, andcivil may be classed into political, judicial and ministerial. Political are such as are not connectedimmediately with the administration of justice, or the execution of the mandates of a superiorofficer. Judicial are those which relates to the administration of justice. Ministerial are those whichgive the officer no power to judge of the matter to be done, and require him to obey the mandates ofa superior. (2 Bouvier L. Dict. 259; 4 Jacob L. Dict. 433; 2 Tomlin 665.)

Thus, as applied to a person, "status" meanscondition, such as being an infant, a slave, a married man or woman, a ward, or a prisoner, and itcan be determined only by the state and not by agreement of the parties.It has been said that while the word "status" undoubtedly implies relations, and that derivatively theterm relates to relationship, status is not a mere relation.Reference is also made to In re Ziegler, 143 N.Y.S. 562 wherein with regard to 'status' it is said:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/89"Whenever a condition in life is determined by law, and not by act of the parties, it is correctlydenominated a status in jurisprudence, and even in the terminology of the common law itself."(B) Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, page 1410:Standing; state or condition; social position.

(Holland. Jurisprudence 88.) The fact of a personbeing legally nominated as junior, having a peculiar relationship with the senior is status, and thecapacity to succeed to the head is the incident of that status.

It has also been considered in Sri Mahalinga Thambiran Swamigal Vs. His Holiness Sri La SriKasivasi Arulnandi Thambiran Swamiga (1974) 1 SCC 150.  It is a judgment delivered bythree-Judges Bench of Apex Court through Hon'ble K.K. Mathew, J. A suit for declaration thatplaintiff Sri Mahalinga Thambiran Swamigal was entitled to continue as Elavarasu or Junior Headof the Kasi Mutt was filed and a perpetual injunction was also prayed for restraining defendant frominterfering in plaintiff's functioning as Junior Head of the Mutt. Defendant pleaded that plaintiffwas not validly nominated as Junior Head of the Mutt, and even if nominated, had acquired no rightto continue as such. His conduct was such that he was unworthy to become Future Head of theMutt, hence his nomination was cancelled and he has no right to seek declaration as prayed for.Trial Court mainly considered the questions, (a) whether plaintiff was nominated by defendant asElavarasu of Kasi Mutt; (b) whether, by virtue of the nomination, plaintiff was holding an office orhad acquired any right or status; (c) whether plaintiff was guilty of misconduct which disentitledhim to continue as Elavarasu; and, (d) whether plaintiff's nomination as the Elavarasu was validlycancelled by the defendant. Trial Court held that though defendant nominated him Elavarasu ofKasi Mutt, but plaintiff neither acquired status nor became holder of an Office by virtue of merenomination. It also held that defendant was competent to cancel nomination even though plaintiffwas not guilty of any misconduct and that it was actually cancelled by executing a ''Will'. Suit wasaccordingly dismissed by Trial Court. In First Appeal, District Judge confirmed findings and decreeof Trial Court and dismissed appeal. In Second Appeal, a single Judge of Madras High Court foundthat by virtue of nomination as Elavarasu, plaintiff became holder of an office or that, at any rate,acquired a 'status'. It also held that defendant could terminate the 'office' or 'status' only for a goodcause and thereafter confirmed findings of Trial Court and appellate Court that plaintiff was notguilty of any misconduct and then held that cancellation of nomination of plaintiff by ''will' wasineffective. As a result, learned single Judge granted a decree to plaintiff declaring that he was dulyappointed Junior Head of Kasi Mutt and entitled to continue as such subject to the right of Head ofMutt to remove him for good cause. Learned single Judge, however, did not make a declaration thatplaintiff had a right to succeed to Headship of Mutt after the lifetime of defendant, nor theinjunction, as prayed for, was granted. Both the parties then preferred intra-Court appeals beforeDivision Bench. The decree passed by learned single Judge was reversed by Division Bench holdingthat plaintiff did not become holder of an office by virtue of nomination, hence, it was open todefendant to cancel nomination without notice to plaintiff and without assigning any reason. Thisdecree passed by Division Bench was challenged in appeal by plaintiff before Supreme Court. Thequestion considered was whether, by virtue of the nomination, plaintiff obtained a 'status' or a rightin law or became holder of an office, and, whether defendant was competent to cancel nominationwithout good cause. Tracing history of Kasi Mutt, Court referred to an earlier judgment of MadrasHigh Court in Giyana Sambandha Pandara Sannadhi Vs. Kandasami Thambira I.L.R. 10 Mad 375and found that Kasi Mutt and another Dharmapuram Adhinam were monastic institutions. Theywere presided over by ascetics who have renounced the world. Mutt at Tiruppanandal i.e. Kasi Muttwas affiliated to Dharmapuram Adhinam as a disciple Adhinam. An Adhinam is a central institutionfrom which the chief ascetic exercises control and supervise over a group of endowed institutionsSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/91and religious trusts. A Thambiran is an ascetic attached to an Adhinam and when he becomes Headof Adhinam, he is referred to as "Pandara Sannadhi". A Mutt was originally established at Benaresby one Kumaragurupara Thambiran of Dharmapuram Adhinam. Dharmapuram Adhinam had comeinto existence several centuries before the institution of Mutt at Benares. Mutt at Tiruppanandal wasestablished later in aid of Mutt at Benares by Tillanayaka Thambiran, a successor ofKumaragurupara Thambiran who functioned between 1720 to 1756. In the course of time, the Muttat Tiruppanandal became the principal Mutt and Mutt at Benares a subsidiary one. It advanced infame, endowments and trusts began to come in. So, subsidiary institutions came to be establishedand Tiruppanandal Mutt ceased to be an isolated institution. It became an important centerexercising supervision and control over several subordinate Mutts in Southern India, over the Muttin Benares, and over Mutts at Merangi in Nepal and at Achiram in Travancore so much so that insome of the later correspondence one finds that Tiruppanandal is referred to as an Adhinam.Dharmapuram Adhinam was regarded by the Thambiran at Tiruppanandal as his Gurupitham, theseat of his religious preceptor. Thambirans at Tiruppanandal, were, in a spiritual sense, subordinateto Pandara Sannadhi at Dharmapuram. In course of time, a Junior Thambiran came to beassociated with Senior Thambiran in management of Tiruppanandal Mutt. The practice inDharampuram Adhinam was that there being a Senior and a Junior "Pandara Sannadhi" at one andthe same time and that was the probable origin of double agency at Tihuppanandal. But, as only a"Pandara Sannadhi" could initiate a Thambiran, it came about that Thambirans for the Mutt atTiruppanandal and Benares came from Dhamapuram Adhinam. During the first part of 19th century(1833 to 1841) there were two managing Thambirans both at Benares and at Tiruppanandal, aSenior and a Junior; and the peculiar feature of this period consisted in this double agency at eachcenter of control, which was probably due to the considerable increase in the number and value ofendowments to be superintended. Court observed that succession to the office of Mahant or Head ofa Mutt is to be regulated by customs of particular Mutt and one who claims the office by right ofsuccession is bound to allege and prove what the custom of the particular institution is, for, the onlylaw regulating succession to such institutions is to be found in the custom and practice of thatinstitution. For this purpose, Court relied on the decisions of Privy Council in Greedharee Doss Vs.Nandokissore Doss, Mohunt (1867) M.I.A. 405 and Ramalingam Pillai Vs. Vythialingam Pillai(1893) 20 I.A. 150, Ramalingam Pillai Vs. Vythialingam Pillai I.L.R. 16 Mad 490.214. It was argued before Court in Sri Mahalinga Thambiran Swamigal (Supra) that Mahant or Headof Mutt is a kind of property and, therefore, nomination by Mahant of his successor amounts todisposal of property after death of Mahant in that particular matter and it will confer a right uponthe nominee or successor in regard to property. This argument was repelled and Court said thatwhere a successor can be nominated or declared by a deed or word of mouth, this is a positive proofto show that nomination is not merely a disposal of office or of properties appertaining to it, but it iscreation of a present relationship generating capacity to succeed to the office and to the propertiesappertaining to the office. By word of mouth or deed one cannot dispose of an office, if it is property,to take effect after the death of the person uttering the word or executing the deed. Therefore,nomination is not a disposal simpliciter of the office of the Headship of the Mutt or its properties, totake effect after the death of the incumbent. Court said:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/92"It is the creation of a relationship generating a capacity in the nominee to succeed to the headshipof the Mutt on the death of the incumbent."215. Court then proceeded to consider what is the nature of that relationship? It said thatnomination is a concept pertaining to Hindu Religious Endowments and it is sui generis. Onecannot put it in the straight jacket of any jurisprudential concept. John Austin in his jurisprudencehas observed that status is "the most difficult problem in the whole science of jurisprudence." Courtobserved, whether a nominee would acquire a status has to be decided with reference to customsfollowed in Mutt. It is well known custom in several Mutts where heads nominate their successors.Whether or not a particular condition or relationship is one of status depends primarily on theexistence and extent of the social interest in the creation and supervision of such a condition orrelationship. The test is not a simple one of the existence or non-existence of the concern of thesociety; it is also one of the degree of such concern. The degree and even the existence of thisconcern in a particular condition will vary from time to time in the same society. Court said, it is notpossible to draw a clear line of distinction in a dogmatic and a priori manner between conditions ofstatus and special conditions not of status. In other words, the picture of status cannot be painted inelemental colours of black and white on any a priori considerations. It is rather a matter for a Courtto decide at the time of action whether a particular condition does or does not involve a sufficientdegree of social interest to be characterised as status, assuming that all other features of status arepresent.216. 'Bentham's' idea of 'status' was that it was "a quality or condition which generates certain rightsand duties". 'Beale' defines 'status' as a personal quality or relationship not temporary in nature norterminable at the mere will of parties with which third parties and even the State are concerned."C.K. Allen" said that 'status' is a condition of belonging to a particular class of persons to whom lawassigns certain capacities and incapacities. 'Graveson' defines 'status' as a special condition of acontinuous and institutional nature, differing from the legal position of the normal person which isconferred by law and not purely by the act of the parties, whenever a person occupies a position ofwhich the creation, continuance or relinquishment and the incidents are a matter of sufficient socialor public concern. The distinguishing mark of a class for the purpose of status is that legalconsequences result to its members from the mere fact of belonging to it.217. In Salvesan Vs. Administrator of Austrian Property (1927) A.C. 641, Lord Haldane whileimposing a question: "For what does status mean in this connection?", answered the same byobserving that in the case of marriage, it is something more than a mere contractual relationbetween the parties to the contract of marriage. He also said that status may result from such acontractual relationship, but only when the contract has passed into something which PrivateInternational Law recognizes as having been superadded to it by the authority of the State,something "which the jurisprudence of the State under its law imposes when within its boundariesthe ceremony has taken place."218. In Nibovet Vs. Nibovet (1878) P.D. (CA) 1, Brett, L.J. said :Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/93"The status of an individual, used as a legal term, means the legal position of the individual in orwith regard to the rest of the community."219. In Sri Mahalinga Thambiran Swamigal (supra), Court said that the fundamental differencebetween 'status' and 'capacity' is that the former is a legal state of being while the latter is a legalpower of doing. 'Status' determines a person's legal condition in community by reference to somelegal class or group and cannot normally be voluntarily changed. The imposition of 'status' carrieswith it attribution of a fixed quota of capacities and incapacities, but it does not directly compel theholder to do or refrain from doing any particular act. Capacity, on the other hand, is a legallyconferred power to affect the rights of oneself and other persons to whom the exercise of thecapacity is directed, subject to certain generally and legally defined limits-limits which vary inrelation to each particular form of capacity. Court said that capacity in this form is an incident ofstatus, and, a distinction therefore must be made between the legal principles applicable to themajor conception of status and those affecting the minor conception of its incidents.220. In Tarak Chandra Das and another Vs. Anukul Chandra Mukherjee A.I.R. 1946 Cal 118, B.K.Mukherjea, J. said :"Now, legal character is the same thing as status."221. It is in this context, Court in Sri Mahalinga Thambiran Swamigal (supra) said that the fact of aperson being legally nominated as Junior, having a peculiar relationship with the Senior is 'status'.Capacity to succeed to the head is the incident of that status. Court also held:" The status, when created by a nomination, cannot be withdrawn or cancelled at the mere will of theparties. The law must determine the condition and circumstances under which it can be terminated.Merely because the status originated from the act of a senior head in making the nomination, itwould not follow that the senior head can put an end to it by another act. ... A contingent interest orownership is a present right."222. The position of Shankaracharya, therefore, is of a special significance. Though an individual isinstalled as 'Shankaracharya' but by its very nature it is a status or position in trust, faith and beliefof millions of Hindu Sanatan Dharma Followers and not in connection with a private right. It hasdeveloped into a different significance in the light of its historical backdrop and cannot be equatedwith a common public or private right to a religious endowment in respect of any property or mereordinary status. Plaintiff himself has admitted in his oral deposition that Mahant of a Math holdproperty of a Math as 'Trustee' while position of Shankaracharya is a 'Mission' and propertyattached with the office is for accomplishment of such Mission.223. It also shows that succession of Shankaracharya will be governed by customs and traditionswhich are within the definition of law under Article 13 of Constitution of India and cannot be variedby certain individuals or group of individuals on their own.(c) About Four Peethas: The Concept of Mutt:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/94224. Adi Shankaracharya was knower of Brahm. To felicitate ascetics to know 'Brahma', he founded"Four Peethas" called "Amnay Peetham".225. Though Sri Goel initially sought to place position of "Amnay Peetham" as commonly knownMutts/Monastries described by certain authors of three kinds and said that it is a "Mourusi Mutt"but from the evidence on record and in particular even from deposition of appellant himself it isevident that both parties do not dispute that position of Peeths established by Adi Shankaracharyaare not like an ordinary Math or Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowment but has a peculiarsignificance and importance for all worshipers and followers of Hindu Sanatan Dharma, who holdAdi Shankaracharya, an incarnation of Lord Shiva.226. Object of founding of four Traditional Vedic Monasteries by "Adi Shankaracharya" lies in"Rigved" 1.164.39; which object has been explained by Adi Sayanacharya in his Bhashya(commentary) thereon. There are two types of Vidyas i.e. Aparavidya and Paravidya.

The non-transcendental nature of Rigveda etc. is described inMundak Shruti. With a vow that 'Two branches are knowable', para vidya (transcendentalknowledge) and apara vidya (non-transcendental knowledge) have been laid down by way of theexpressions Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samveda etc. therein. The four Vedas having the element ofnon-transcendental knowledge and being expressive of riks (extolling hymns) etc., with their sixparts (angas), describe the imperishable, invisible, non-decaying, indestructible, eternal anduniversal Supreme Being (Brahm) in actual form. O Gargi! In the system helmed by this Akshar, theSun and the Moon are positioned which facilitates us to know that indestructible (Supreme Being);that is Para-vidya (transcendental knowledge), by which we attain the knowledge of Akshar andSatya Purush (Real Being). In these Shrutis (revealed texts), the word 'Akshar' is famous to beBrahm Vachak (denoter of the Supreme Being). The word Rik (extolling hymns) and Akshar(supreme being) are related to each other as Pratipadya (what is propounded) and Patipadak (onewho propounds). 'I seek that Upnishadic Purush'. As per such Shrutis, all the Vedas impart theknowledge of Brahm (the Supreme Being). When knowledge of the Brahm is the subject ofUpnishads, why Samhitas and other parts are called Brahm Vishyak (concerned about the SupremeBeing). On arising of such doubts, it is said that although Samhitas and other parts, besidesUpanishads, mostly speak of Yagya (sacrifice), Brahmins seek to know that Atma (the being)through self-study of Vedas, Yagya (sacrifice), Daan (charity) and Tap (practice of austerity). As persuch Shrutis, by means of purification of mind through performance of the Vedic rituals, it willresult in knowledge relating to Brahm. That Supreme being is incomparable and is like the Sky. Onthe basis of similarities such as being Nirlep (detached), Arup (formless) and Vyapak (expanded),the Brahm (the Supreme Being) is called Akash (infinite). That is to say, He is mainly a protector ofall; hence, he is called Akash. The entire world having been installed within himself and beingprotector, none has existence apart from that Brahm. That is to say, all is imbibed in that Reality.This is the Supreme Soul under whose shelter all the demigods reside. That is to say, they aresituated in the Reality possessed of the aforesaid features and in whom all the Vedas along with theirAngas (limbs) reside characterised by Riks (verses). If a person who does not know the reality ofBrahm who is the place of stay of all demi Gods in various forms and is interpretation of all Vedas,then what purpose will be served if such a person go through the web of words of aforesaid Rigvedaetc. That is to say, what will he attain by not knowing the Brahm, knowable by way of the Vedas, thesources of knowledge? The import is that the purpose of attaining the Brahm not beingaccomplished, he will get nothing by performing rituals etc. prescribed in Vedas. That is to say, incase any person, after knowing Akshar (Brahm), performs rituals and yagyas (sacrificialperformances), anything done by him does not constitute any karma (fruitive action). Whosoevergets to know this Reality (Supreme Being), is duly situated in his inner self being Brahm GyaniSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/96(knower of Brahm). (English translation by Court)227. "Purush Sukta" says that Vedas originated from Supreme-self i.e. Brahm. (Yajurved 31.7,Maharshi Dayanand Sarswati bhashya of 1877 AD as transalated in English by Devi Chand 1992Edn.

Parts of Manuscript of this voluminous book wereavailable in different libraries of various Provinces of India; complete book was available in thelibrary of Raghunath temple, Jammu. On the basis of that very copy, this valuable book has beenpublished this year itself in two volumes from Kashmir. Keeping in view the order/sequence ofworship of Srividya, interpretation of all principles of Tantra Shastra has exhaustively been made init. By way of reference, some description of Guru Prampara and Shisya Parampara (Tradition ofMaster-disciple) is found. Acharya Shanker was deeply indulged with worship of Srividya. Its proofis found not only in Trantrik Books but also from observance of methods of worship prevailing inPeethas established by Acharya. There are "Sriyantra" placed in special Mathas of Acharya, worshipwhereof is given an important place in the duties assigned to Mathadhish. It is also amply proved bythe books authored by Shanker.

Respective Guru Parampara of Shanker runs as follows: Gaudpad, PawakParacharya, Satyanidhi, Ramchandra, Govind and Shankar. It goes to prove that there is nocontradiction about Shanker being disciple of Govind but he had no close relation with Gaudpad.According to current prevalent theory there was a relation of Master-Disciple between Gaudpad andShukdev, but, there being interval of long period, historians feel shy in accepting this relation. In theopinion of some of Scholars, a deep historic fact is hidden inside this relation. It is quite possiblethat old stream of Advait philosophy, for certain reasons became wholly abandoned after Shukdevji.Later on, Gaudpad having learnt from Divyamurti the secret of Advait philosophy of Sukhdevji-whohad emerged through divine means, promulgated/promoted the same again. But why the orthodoxhistorians should have faith in such divine interpretation but the historians cannot escape frombeing satisfied that according to Srividyarnav, Gaudpad was not real disciple of Shukdevji; insteadthere existed long tradition of Acharyas in between the two. According to this book, Shankar Sectcommenced from great Adi learned Maharishi Kapil. Masters/teachers ranging between Kapil toGaudpad are as follows: - Kapil, Atri, Vashisht, Sanak ,(5) Sanandan, Bhrigu, Sanatsujat, Vamdev,Narad, (10), Gautam, Shaunak, Shakti, Markandey, Kaushak, (15) Parasar, Shuk, Angira, Kanv,Jabali (20) Bharadwaj, Vedvyas, Eishan, Raman, Kapardi (25) Bhudhar, Subhat, Jalaj, Bhutesh,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/102Param (30) Vijay, Maran(Bharat), Padmesh, Subhag, Vishuddh (35) Samar, Kaivalya, Ganeshwar,Sapay, Vibudh (40) Yog, Vigyan, Anang, Vibhram, Damodar (45) Chidabhas, Chinmay, Kaladhar,Vishweswar, Mandar (50) Tridash, Sagar, Mrid, Harsh, Singh (55) Gaud, Veer, Aghor, Dhruva,Diwakar (60) Chakdradhar, Prapyesh, Chaturbhuj, Anand Bhairav, Dheer (65) Gaudpad.

Instead of figuring the name of Vedvyas, father of Shuk, before him, the samefigures after his four disciples. According to this list, names of forty nine Acharyas are written inbetween (17) Shuk and Gaudpad).

Names of Sanyasi disciples are: (1)Padmapada (2) Bodh (3) Geervan (4) Anandteerth and (5) like the name of Guru, name of fifthdisciple was Shanker. Names of Grihasth disciples are: (6) Sunder (7) Vishnusharma (8) Laxman (9)Mallikarjun (10) Trivikram (11) Sridhar (12) Kapardi (13) Keshav and (14) Damodar.Shishya/Parampara of these chief disciples was also quite extensive.(1) Padmpad - He had six disciples- Mandal, Paripawak, Nirvan, Girvan, Chidanand and Shivottam,who all were Sanyasis -(2) Bodhacharya - He had many disciples who were spread in Kerala Region. Alike Guru he had alsodisciples of two categories - Grihi and Sanyasi.(3) Geervan - His chief disciple was Vidvadgeervan, whose Shishya Parampara is as follows-Vidvadgeervan-Vibhudhendra-Sudheendra-Mantrageervan.His disciples were Grihi and Sanyasiboth.(4) Anandteerth - All disciples were Grihasth and worshipped Padukapeeth.(5) Shankar- His disciples were owner of Mathas and Upmathas.(6) Sunderacharya- There were three kinds of disciples. Grihi, Sanyasi and Peethnayak.(7) Vishnusharma-Name of his principal disciple was Pragalbhacharya. Vidyaranya Yati author ofthe book Shrividyarnav was disciple of this Pragalbhacharya. This book appears to be a Siddha bookon completion of whereof the Goddess of the world appeared before his devotee and asked forbegging some boon. Author of the book had no any worldly desire which he could have begged fromthe Goddess Bhagwati. He only desired that when a man seeing the method contained in this book,treating it his Guru involve in Japa even without Deeksha, he should attain Siddhi. GoddessBhagwati offered boon and disappeared herself.(8) Laxmanacharya -The fact of his materialistic Siddhi/realisation has been mentioned in the book.He was a great Siddha. Once he visited the Capital of King Praudhdev. The king honoured him inopen Court and gifted precious clothes. Siddhaji on reaching home, burnt those clothes. On hearingthe news, the king demanded his clothes. With the power of his Siddhi/realisation, Laxmanacharyareturned those clothes but simultaneously, after cursing, he procceded towards south. on greatSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/104persuasion by Praudhdev, he was pleased but said that his utterance could not be otherwise; you willcertainly get a son but would be deprived of his pleasure. It so happened. As soon as the child cameinto womb, Praudhdev died. Responsibility of the kingdom was conferred on Shri Vidyaranya.According to Shrichakra, he founded Shri Vidyanagar and after handing over the responsibility ofkingdom to Ambdev, renunciated author invented various Tantras and composed this book.(9) Disciple of Mallikaarjun lived in Vindhyachal, (10) disciple of Trivikram resided in Jagannathregion, (11) disciple of Shridhar lived in Gauddesh, Bengal and Mithila, (12) disciples of Kapardiresided in Kashi, Ayodhya etc. places.

These preachings are famous as Mahanushasan. It was very rigid rule of Acharya thatHeads of Peeth with a view to maintain the glory of the country and for propagation of Dharma,should always go on visiting the provinces within their territory. They should not permanentlyreside in their Math. They should protect Varnashram Dharma and virtues propounded by Acharyain their respective provinces, strictly in accordance with Rules. There is always possibility of religionbeing ruined by laziness. Therefore, it is the sacrosanct duty of Acharya of every Math to happilyindulge in protecting the religion. Adhyaksh of one Math should not enter/interfere with the facultyof Adhyaksh of other Math. As a joint venture, all Acharyas should maintain a great religious systemin India, so that Vedic religion remains progressive incessantly.

For this office, various virtues are compulsoritly required. Only a pious,Jitendriya (conquerors of senses), well versed in Ved Vedanga, knower of Yoga, leaned-well versedin all Shastras, is eligible to hold the seats of Maths. If a Head of a Math is not possessed of thesevirtues, scholars should abandon him irrespective of the fact that he has been installed on the seat.Meaning thereby, even a virtueless person if appointed as Head of Math, dethroning such personfrom the seat is the command of Shankaracharya."A person having aforesaid virtues should be seated on Peeth, otherwise, even if installed, should bedethroned (abandoned) by learned people."fo}ku yksx gh /keZ ds fu;Urk gksrs gSa] vr% vkpk;Z us eBk/;{kksa ds pfj= dh ns[k&js[k bl ns'k dsizkS<+ fo}kuksa ds Ãij gh j[k NksM+h gSA bl fo"k; esa fo}kuksa dk cM+k drZO; gSA xq.kghulaU;klh /keZ dh dFkefi lqO;oLFkk ugha dj ldrkA blh dkj.k 'kadjkpk;Z us mls in ls P;qr djus dkvf/kdkj fo}kuksa dks ns fn;k gSA vkpk;Z us bu v/;{kksa dks /keZ ds mn~ns'; ls jktlh BkV&ckV ls jgusdk mins'k fn;k gS ijUrq blesa LokFkZ dh cqf) izcy u gksdj midkj cqf) gh eq[; gksuh pkfg,A ihBksa dsv/;{kksa dks rks Lo;a i|i= dh rjg txr~ ds O;ogkjksa ls fufyZIr jguk pkfg,A mudk thou gh o.kkZJe /keZdh izfr"Bk ds fy, gSA mUgsa ru&eu&/ku yxkdj bl dk;Z ds lEiknu ds fy, iz;Ru'khy cuuk pkfg,A ;fn os,slk djus esa leFkZ ugha gSa rks ml egRoiw.kZ in ds vf/kdkjh os dHkh Hkh ugha gks ldrs ftldhLFkkiuk Lo;a vkpk;Z&pj.kksa us oSfnd /keZ ds vH;qn; ds fy, vius gkFk ls dh FkhA Learned peopleare the controller of religion. Therefore, supervision over character of Head of Maths has beenassigned to mature scholars of this country. A heavy duty is owed to learned people in this regard. Avirtue-less Sanyasi can never properly regulate Dharma. Therefore, Shankaracharya conferred thepower of dethroning him from the seat on learned persons. Acharya has preached these Heads tolive a royal life from religious point of view, but instead of bearing strong element of selfishness,there should mainly be the strong element of welfare. Heads of Peethas themselves should remainunattached from materialistic affairs. Their entire life is dedicated to the installation of VarnashramDharm. They should strive for implementation of this work, physically, mentally, and economically.If they are not capable in doing so, they can never be eligible for that important office, which wasestablished by Acharya himself for resurrection of Vedic Relgiion.vkpk;Z ds ;s mins'k fdrus mnkRr] fdrus mnkj rFkk fdrus mikns; gSa! blls Li"V izrhr gksrk gS fdvkpk;Z dk O;ogkjKku] 'kkL=Kku dh vis{kk dFkefi ?kVdj ugha FkkA ;g egkuq'kklu vk;Z /keZ ds fy,lpeqp egku~ vuq'kklu gSA* "How exalted, liberal and useful the preachings of Acharya are !

During course of argument, it is also stressed on the part of appellant that validity ofappointment of Head of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth would not be within the purview of judicial reviewinasmuch, it is a part and parcel of established customs or usages relating to particular "religiousdenomination" and being fundamental right guaranteed under Article 25 and 26 of Constitution ofIndia, Court would not be entitled to examine whether an installed Shankaracharya in a particularSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/106Amnaya Peeth, is duly qualified or not, when following Guru-Shishya Parampara, outgoingShankaracharya has nominated or appointed his successor and it is sufficient to uphold suchnomination for the reason that wisdom of outgoing Shankaracharya has to be honoured.244. Wide submission as advanced, we find it difficult to subscribe for the reason that fundamentalright to manage religious affairs by every religious denomination or section thereof in the mannerprotected by Articles 26 and 27 would not be affected where a dispute arose that as per establishedcustoms or usages, and written scriptures applicable to such religious denomination, a personinstalled as Head of Mutt is not validly appointed/installed or his installation is illegal and contraryto such customs or usages including written conditions of established religious scriptures applicableto such religious denomination.245. Under Part III of Constitution, Article 13 includes within the term ' 'Law', custom, or usageshaving force of law in the territory of India. Which custom or usage having force of law is operating,and whether customs and usage have been correctly observed or followed, whenever this question israised before a Court of Law, it can very well examine the same. So far as interpretation, whethersuch custom and usage having force of law is existing and operating, is a mixed question of fact andlaw and can be well examined by Court by exercising its judicial review. This also includes within itsambit true meaning of words like 'Mutt', 'Religious denomination', 'Head of Mutt', 'Mahant' etc.246. In the present case, the capacity and legality of installation of parties as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth is attracting attention of Court. This question involves civil rights ofrespective parties and same can be examined.247. The concept of 'Mutt' and 'religious denomination' which is said to have its noticeable historywith establishment of Peethas by Adi Shankaracharya has also gone reformation/ change of conceptwith establishment of different Mutts by subsequent Hindu Sanantan Dharma's Preachers, SocialReformers, Sanyasis and Acharyas etc. It would also be necessary to have a bird eye view to thatconcept for the reason that difference of four Peethas established by Adi Shankaracharya with thatof Mutts and religious endowments came to be established subsequently from time to time is,evident from the fact that persons installed as Shankaracharyas in four Peethas have a differentreverence, respect and followership in Sanatan Dharma giving them a supreme place, though as perlocal traditions, customs and beliefs, many other subsequently established Mutts/ Monasteries andreligious endowments also have a large followers. Here again counsel for parties have not disputedthat Shankaracharyas of four Peethas have a peculiar, unique and supreme reverence amongst thefollowers of Sanatan Dharma and they are looked with a different status, equivalent to God.248. The known historicity of concept of "Mutt" or "Peeth" relates back to the period of AdiShankaracharya. Both the parties, during the course of argument have admitted that earlier thereto,there was custom, tradition and practice of Guru/Acharya Shiksha in Ashramas where spiritual,social, strategic and other training used to be given, keeping students in Ashramas like a whole timeBoarding School but that was a concept nothing to do with "Mutt", Akharas, Religious Endowmentsetc. These concepts are different.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/107249. As already said, Adi Shankaracharya established four Peeths, known as "Amnay Peeth" and incommon layman language are called Hindu Mutts in four corners of Country, i.e., Govardhan Mathat Puri, Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth at Badrinath, Sharda Math at Dwarka and Sringeri Math atTungbhadra. With the passage of time, this practice expanded by many renowned scholars, some ofthem are worth mentioned hereat.250. "Ramanuj", later on called 'Ramanujacharya', was born in 1017 A.D., in village Perumbudur,about twenty-five miles west of Madras. His father was Kesava Somayaji and his mother wasKantimathi. Ramanuja's Tamil name was Ilaya Perumal. Quite early in life, Ramanuja lost hisfather. Then he came to Kancheepuram to pursue his study of 'Vedas' under one 'Yadavaprakasha', ateacher of Advaita philosophy. While studying, Ramanuj gave his own interpretations on certainVaidik text contrary to that of his Teacher. At the end of tenth Century, "Visishtadvaita" system ofphilosophy was well established in Southern India. Followers of this creed were in-charge ofimportant Vaishnavite temples at Kancheepuram, Srirangam, Tirupathi and other important places.The Head of important Vaishnavite institution was 'Yamunacharya', a great sage and profoundscholar. He was also Head of the Mutt at Srirangam. One of his disciples, 'Kanchipurna', was servingin the temple at Kancheepuram. It is said that he was a Sudra, but Kanchipurna was so pious andgood that people of the place had great respect and reverence for him. We are informed that there isa Temple at Kancheepuram where Kanchipurna's image has been installed and he is worshipped asa saint.251. Be that as it may, Ramanuj came under Kanchipurna's influence. There are some stories, as tohow Ramajun abandoned his family life, but the fact remains that Ramanuj abandoned life ofhouseholder and became "Sanyasi". 'Yamunacharya' became very old and was looking out for ayoung person to take his place as Head of Mutt at Srirangam. He heard about Ramanuj and invitedhim but by the time Ramanuj reached Srirangam, Yamunacharya was dead. As per wishes ofYamunacharya, Ramanuj was installed as Head of "Visishtadvaita" Mutt at Srirangam and tooksolemn promises to fulfill the wishes of Yamunacharya, i.e., a Visishtadvaita Bhashya should bewritten for Brahma Sutras of Vyasa which till then had been taught orally to the disciples ofVisishtadvaita philosophy and that the names of 'Parasara', author of 'Vishnu Purana', and Saint'Sadagopa' should be perpetuated. Commentary of 'Brahma Sutras' written by 'Ramanuj' is knownas "Sri Bhashya". It is said that Visishtadvaita system is an ancient one. It was expounded byBodhayana in his Vritti, written about 400 B.C. and Ramanuj followed Bodhayana in hisinterpretations of Brahma Sutras. Followers of Ramanuj's sect of Vaishnavas are called SriSampradaya. Ramanuj also wrote "Vedanta Sara"(essence of Vedanta), "Vedanta Sangraha" (aresume of Vedanta) and "Vedanta Deepa" (the light of Vedanta). He travelled throughout the lengthand breadth of India including Kashi, Kashmir and Badrinath. It is said that Ramanuj lived about120 years.252. We are not going in details of teaching of Ramanuj, which was basically of "advaita", butconcept was slightly modified as "Visishtadvaita" and has some modification on the teachings of AdiShankaracharya. What we basically find for our purpose is that concept of Mutt was strengthenedand continued by one of the known great Saints, i.e., 'Ramanujacharya'.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/108253. "Ramanand" had its origin sometimes between 1300 to 1380 A.D. He mostly lived in Varanasiand is recognized as founder of "Ramanandi Sampradaya". It is said that after philosophy of'Visishtadvaita' propounded by Ramanujacharya, there was some dissent amongst the followers ofShankar on the concept of Advaita for the kind of Nirguna Brahma and concept of Advaitism for thekind of Saguna Brahma, i.e, God with attributes. According to later philosophy, God is SagunaBrahma. The creative process and all the objects in creation are real but not illusory as held by AdiSankaracharya. Therefore, God, soul, matter are real. But God is inner substance and rest are hisattributes. Adi Shankaracharya basically said everything for Brahamins. Ramanuja, on the contrary,also invited downtrodden to Vaishnavism. In this way, one theory was divided into two. He was bornat Allahabad and initially a great follower of ''Ramanujacharya. Later he founded his own sect andpreached his principles in Hindi at Banaras and Agra. He was a worshipper of Rama. It is said thathe was first to employ vernacular medium to propagate his ideas. Simplification of worship andemancipation of people from traditional caste rules were his two important contributions to theBhakti movement. He opposed caste system and chose his disciples from all sections of society. Hisdisciples included Kabir, Raidas, Narahari etc. The period of Swami Ramanand is taken as 1299 to1410 C.E. Followers of Ramanand are called as "Ramats", a sect of Vaishnavas founded byRamanand. His area of function mostly constituted aesthetic population found in Banaras andAyodhya. Ramanand also established several Maths, consisting only of 'celibates'. They obey nocaste rules and even Sudras are in their brotherhood. "Ramats" worship only 'Rama' and they callthemselves "Dass" (servants of Lord).254. In thirteenth century, "Madhavacharya" from Kannada region came to propagate Dvaita ordualism of Jivatma and Paramatma. According to his philosophy, world is not an illusion but areality. God, soul, matter are unique in nature.255. "Nimbarka" and "Vallabhacharya" were also other preachers of Vaishnavite Bhakti inTelungana region. 'Surdas' was disciple of 'Vallabhacharya' and he popularized Krishna cult innorthern India. Similarly, in Rajasthan, 'Mirabai' came as a great devotee of Lord Krishna andspread Bhakti in Lord Krishna through her bhajans. In Northern India, particularly in Avadh,'Tulsidas' in 1500-1600 AD, a worshipper of Lord Rama, composed Ramcharitmanas, the Hindiversion of Ramayana. In this era of Bhakti cult, in 14th and 15th century, Kabir and Nanak alsobecame great apostles of Bhakti cult. They drew inspiration from old masters but propoundedteachings in a new concept and refined path. They tried to solve problems of common people arisingfrom age-old superstitions and propounded path of salvation through Bhakti or pure devotion.256. Adi Shankaracharya also constituted 'Dashnami Akhara' associated with Amnay Peetham, i.e.,four peethas established by him. Tradition of Akharas, we find in subsequent period also, inasmuch'Swami Brijanand' and 'Balanand' who belong to Ramanandi sect of Bairagies established three'Anni' known as (1) 'Nirmohi', (2) 'Digamber' and (3) 'Nirwani'. These Annis were established forprotection and improvement of "Chatuha Ramanandi Sampraday" comprising of seven Akharas,namely, (1) Sri Panch Ramanandi Nirmohi Akhara, (2) Sri Panch Ramanandi Nirwani Akhara, (3)Sri Panch Ramanandi Digambari Akhara, (4) Sri Panch Ramanandi Santoshi Akhara, (5) Sri PanchRamanandi Khaki Akhara, (6) Sri Panch Ramanandi Niralambi and (7) Sri Panch Ramanandi MahaNirwani. These Akharas work as "Panchayati Maths", function on democratic pattern. The realSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/109power vests in Panch. Appointment of Mahant is by election. The person, who is elected byPanchayat becomes Head of Akhara.257. "Maths", "religious denomination" as also "Panchayati Maths" have a well known concept.From the material placed herein, we find that a "Math" has been considered as an important kind ofHindu religious endowment. It spells differently at places, namely, 'Math', 'Mutt' or 'Muttum'. Inordinary language, it signifies an "abode" or "residence" of ascetics. In legal parlance, it connotes a"monastic institution" presided over by a Superior and established for the use and benefit of asceticsbelonging to a particular order, who generally are disciples or co-disciples of the superior.258. Detailed history and other characteristics of religious institution, i.e., "Math" has beendiscussed in the erudite work of Dr. B.K. Mukherjea's, "The Hindu Law of Religious and CharitableTrusts" (Tagore Law Lectures) (hereinafter referred to as "Mukherjea's Hindu Law"), which was firstpublished in 1952 and we are referring relevant extract from its 4th edition, edited by P.B.Gajendragadkar and P.M. Bakshi. It is stated in para 7.5 at page 332 that Hindu Maths wereestablished for the first time by Adi Shankaracharya. He himself founded four Maths at the fourcorners of India and made them centres of his Vedantik teaching. Each of these Maths was placed inthe charge of one of his four principal disciples, who were, Padmapad, Hastamalak, Sureswar andTrotaka. These four disciples had their own disciples also. In the course of time ten orders or classesof monks were formed, into which the monks of Shankar School stood divided. These ten orderspopularly known as 'Dasnamis' bear the title Tirtha, Asrama, Vana, Aranya, Giri, Parvat, Sagar,Saraswati, Bharati and Puri. The disciples of Trotaka at Jyotir Mutt at Badrinath were Giri, Parvatand Sagar, while Sringeri Math claimed as its adherents Saraswati, Bharati and Puri. In addition toSanyasis who belong to the fourth stage of life, there were "Naishthik Brahmacharis" or perpetualstudents attached to all Maths. This practice started by Adi Shankaracharya was followed by almostall the religious teachers since then. First in order of time was Sri Ramanujacharya,who propoundedtheory "qualified monism" in opposition to the "pure monism" of Adi Shankaracharya. Shankar'stheory was based upon rigorous logic, recognised Supreme Brahma as the only one and absolutereality. It regarded everything else as phenomenal or illusory. Ramanuj and other Vaishnavateachers who followed him were all philosophical theists. They tried to reconcile their metaphysicaldoctrines with the yearnings of human heart which always requires a personal God as the supremecause of all that exists and an eternal soul which yearns for "an approach to an union with thatBeing". Followers of Ramanuj are known as "Sri Vaishnavas". The object of their adoration is"Supreme" being in the form of "Vishnu" who is always associated with "Shri" or "Lakshmi". On themodel of Dashnami Maths of Shankaracharya, Ramanuj founded a large number of Maths for thepurpose of strengthening the doctrine propounded by him. Then came Sri Ramanand (born in 1299A.D.), disciple of Ramanuj. He founded a sect of Vaishnavas known as "Ramats". Ramanand himselfis said to have built a Math, for the "ascetics" of his sect, in Benares. The "Ramats" worship one Godin the form of Ram.259. Ordinarily an 'ascetic' (Sanyasi) is one who renounces the world and devotes himself toreligion, owns no property, no fixed place of residence and accepts such food and lodgings as areprovided by pious householders. If a pious ascetic gathers around him a number of disciples whomhe initiates into the mysteries or tenets of his order and such of his disciples intend to becomeSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/110'ascetics', renounce all connection with their family including family wealth and completely affiliatethemselves with the said spiritual teacher, a spiritual fraternity would eventually grow up. If pious,generous persons endow such a fraternity with property, it naturally vests in the Preceptor for thetime being and a home is created for the brotherhood, i.e., a Math and that would lead to theconstitution and building of a Math. Once the "Math" is established, succession to headship takesplace within spiritual family according to the usages that grow up in a particular institution.260. The term "Math" has been described in "Law Lexicon"-The Encyclopaedic Law Dictionary by P.Ramanatha Aiyer (1997) at page 1205 as under:"Math. Although there are some differences between debuttar property and property dedicated to amath, where the math is an idol installed in it, property appertaining to a math, whether dedicatedto the idol or not, is not the personal property of the head of the math; and when the holder orMahant is not only a sanyasi but also a celibate, the property is utterly incapable of passing tonatural heirs. The fact that the holder executes a hibanama in which he describes the math as hismath carries little weight; the math with the idol cannot be his personal property. The presumptionin the case of a mahant who is a sanyasi and a celibate, having no family of his own, and who is freefrom all worldly attachments, is that the property held or acquired by him is so held or acquired onbehalf of the math to which his life is entirely devoted. A presumption of the same kind would arisein respect of the property subsequently acquired by such celibate Mahant. Susil Chandra Sen andanother v. Gobind Chandra Das and another, 6 RP 705=150 IC 61=AIR 1934 Pat 431.The term 'Math' is used in the sense either of an institution or of a building. Maths are in the natureof monastic institutions and the term may also be used for the building in which such an institutionis housed. Where originally there was a banking or money-lending business which passed from eachof its proprietors to his chosen successor, chosen for his business capacity and not for his learning orpiety, and there was no religious object behind the business but they called themselves sanyasis andtheir residence 'Math', it was held that the property acquired by the proprietors could not be claimedto be 'Math' properties as there was no 'Math" in the legal sense of the word. Mayanand Gir v.Parshottamanand Gir, 1943 ALJ 400=1943 OWN (HC) 250.An institution comes within the definition of 'math' if it satisfies three conditions; (i) that theinstitution be for the promotion of the Hindu Religion; (ii) that it be presided over by a personwhose duty is to engage himself in-spiritual service or who exercises or claims to exercise spiritualheadship over a body of disciples; and (iii) that the office of such person devolves in accordance withthe directions of the founder of the institution or is regulated by usage Srinivas Das v. Surjanarayan,AIR 1967 SC 256, 259. [Orissa Hindu Religious Endowments Act (4 of 1939), Sec. 6(7)]" (emphasisadded)261. In Sammantha Pandara Vs. Sellappa Chetti ILR 2 (1878-81) Madras 175, Madras High Courtdiscusses origin of 'Math' as under:"The origin of mattams is ordinarily as follows : A preceptor of religious doctrine gathers aroundhim a number of disciples whom he initiates into the particular mysteries of the order, and instructsSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/111in its religious tenets. Such of these disciples as intend to become religious teachers, renounce theirconnection with their family and all claims to the family wealth, and, as it were, affiliate themselvesto the spiritual teacher whose, school they have entered. Pious persons endow the schools withproperty which is vested in the preceptor for the time being, and a home for the school is erectedand a mattam constituted. The property of the mattam does not descend to the disciples or elders incommon; the preceptor, the head of the institution, selects among the affiliated disciples him whomhe deems the most competent, and in his own life-time installs the disciple so selected as hissuccessor, not uncommonly with some ceremonies. After the death of the preceptor the disciple sochosen is installed in the gaddi, and takes by succession the property which has been held by hispredecessor. The property is in fact attached to the office and passes by inheritance to no one whodoes not fill the office. It is in a certain sense trust property; it is devoted to the maintenance of theestablishment, but the superior has large dominion over it, and is not accountable for itsmanagement nor for the expenditure of the income, provided he does not apply it to any purposeother than what may fairly be regarded as in furtherance of the objects of the institution. Acting forthe whole institution he may contract debts for purposes connected with his mattam, and debts socontracted might be recovered from the mattam property and would devolve as a liability on hissuccessor to the extent of the assets received by him.We do not of course mean to lay it down that there are not mattams which may have beenestablished for purposes other than those we have described, nor that the property may not in somecases be held on different conditions and subject to different incidents. We have, described thenature of the generality of such institutions and the incidents of the property which is devoted totheir maintenance." (emphasis added)262. Considering, what is meant by a 'Math', a Division Bench of Madras High Court in GiyanaSambandha Pandara Sannadhi Vs. Kandasami Tambiran 1887 ILR Vol. 10 Madras 375 held:"The origin of these associations, their constitution and development, form part of the history of theestablishment and spread of the Brahminical system of religious doctrine among the Sudracommunities in Southern India. Originally, the ascetic, who renounced the world and devotedhimself to religion, confined his attention to the study of theology, to imparting religious instructionto his disciples, and to complying with the ordinances prescribed for the guidance of his order. Hethen owned no property, except his cloths, sandals, religious books and the idol he kept for hispersonal worship and a few other articles of trifling value which were absolutely necessary(Mitakshara, Chap. II, s. 8, para. 8). He had no fixed residence and moved from village to village,accepting such lodgings and food as were provided for him by pious laymen, who were in their turnenjoined by the Shastras to honour and support him. This is the mode in which Brahman Sanniyasislive even at the present time. In several villages pious laymen erected buildings for the residence ofhermits when they visited their villages, and these were called Mutts. In its original and narrowsense, then, the term "Mutt" signified the residence of an ascetic or Sanniyasi or Paradesi.But when the Buddhists assailed the Brahminical religion and when Sankarachariyar, the founder ofthe Advaita or non-dualistic school of philosophy, ultimately prevailed against them, he establishedsome Mutts in order to maintain and strengthen the doctrine and the system of religions philosophySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/112he taught, Sanniyasis being placed at the head of those institutions. After Sankarachariyar, thefounders of the Vaishnava, Madhva and other schools of religious philosophy in this Presidencyestablished Mutts for a similar purpose. In former times these institutions exercised considerableinfluence over the laymen in their neighbourhood; they became centres of classical and religiouslearning and materially aided in promoting religious knowledge and in encouraging religious andother charities. The ascetics who presided over them were held, owing to their position as religiouspreceptors, and often also in consequence of their own learning and piety, in great reverence byHindu princes and noblemen, who from time to time made large presents to them and endowed theMutts under their control with grants of land. Thus, a class of endowed Mutts came into existence inthe nature of monastic institutions, presided over by ascetics or Sanniyasis who had renounced theworld. Thus, the ascetic who originally owned little or no property, came to own the Matam underhis charge and its endowment, in trust for the maintenance of the Mutt, for his own support, for thatof his disciples, and for the performance of religious and other charities in connection with it,according to usage." (emphasis added)263. In Vidyapurna Tirtha Swami Vs. Vidyanidhi Tirtha Swami 1904 ILR Vol. XXVII Madras 435,Madras High Court, following its earlier decision in Sammantha Pandara Vs. Sellappa Chetti(supra), observed with respect to original growth of 'Math' in this country as under:"The origin and growth of mutts in this country is thus described in the two judgments of this Courtalready referred to : "A preceptor of religious doctrine gathers around him a number of discipleswhom he initiates into the particular mysteries of the order and instructs in its religious tenets. Suchof these disciples as intend to become religious teachers renounce their connection with the familyand all claims to the family wealth and, as it were, affiliate themselves to the spiritual teacher whoseschool they have entered. Pious persons endow the schools with property which is vested in thepreceptor for the time being and a home for the school is erected and mattam constituted" (GiyanaSambandha Pandara Sannadhi v. Kandasami Tambiran I.L.R., 10 Mad., 375). "The ascetics whopresided over them were held, owing to their position as religious preceptors and often also inconsequence of their own learning and piety, in great reverence by Hindu princes and noblemenwho, from time to time, made large presents to them and endowed the mutts under their controlwith grants of land. Thus a class of endowed mutts came into existence, in the nature of monasticinstitutions, presided over by ascetics or sanniyasis who had renounced the world." The object ofthese mutts is generally the promotion of religious knowledge, the imparting of spiritual instructionto be disciples and followers of the mutt and "the maintenance and strengthening of the doctrinesand tenets of particular schools of philosophy."264. What has been said in Giyana Sambandha Pandara Sannadhi (supra), was followed in KailasamPillai Vs. Nataraja Thambiran and Ors. 1910 I.L.R. 33 Madras 265 at page 267.265. Privy Council in Ram Parkash Das Vs. Anand Das and Ors. AIR 1916 Privy Council 256 had alsooccasion to consider about 'Math' and observed:"An asthal, commonly known in Northern India as a muth, is an institution of a monastic nature. Itis established for the service of a particular cult, the instruction in its tenets and the observance ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/113its rites. The followers of the cult and disciples in the institution are known as chelas; the chelas areof two classes celibate and non-celibate. In the asthal now being dealt with, the religious brethrenwere the bairagi or celibate chelas; the lay brethren were girhast or householder chelas. The mahantmust, by the custom of the muth, be a bairagi or religious chela." (emphasis added)266. Again in Sri Vidya Varuthi Thirth Swamigal Vs. Baluswami Ayyar and Ors. AIR 1922 P.C. 123,Privy Council expressed its views on page 126 about "Maths" in the following words:"In many cases in Southern India, especially where the diffusion of Aryan Brahmanism was essentialfor bringing the Dravidian peoples under the religious rule of the Hindu system, colleges andmonasteries under the names of Mutt were founded under spiritual teachers of recognised sanctity.These men had and have ample discretion in the application of the funds of the institution, butalways subject to certain obligations and duties, equally governed by custom and usage."267. Concept of Mutt, private and public, has been considered in Bihar State Board of ReligiousTrust Vs. Mahant Sri Biseshwar Das, AIR 1971 SC 2057, and in para 17, Court observed :"A religious mutt in northern India is usually known as asthal, a monastic institution founded forthe maintenance and spread of a particular sampradaya or cult. The distinction between dedicationto a temple and a mutt is that in the former case it is to a particular deity, while in the latter, it is to asuperior or a mahant. ... A mutt can be dedicated for the use of ascetics generally or for the asceticsof a particular sect or cult, in which case it would be a public institution. Mutts have generallysadavrats, i.e. arrangements for giving food and shelter to wayfarers and ascetics attached to them.They may have temples to which the public is allowed access." (emphasis added)268. All the aforesaid decisions were considered in Shri Krishna Singh Vs. Mathura Ahir and others1981 (3) SCC 689=AIR 1980 SC 707. In para 19, Court concluded as under:"19. ..............Math means a place for the residence of ascetics and their pupils, and the like. Sincethe time of Sankaracharya, who established Hindu maths, these maths developed into institutiondevoted to the teaching of different systems of Hindu religious philosophy, presided over by ascetics,who were held in great reverence as religious preceptors, and princes and noblemen endowed theseinstitutions with large grants of property."269. In Krishna Singh (supra), Court also observed that a Math is an institutional sanctum presidedover by a superior who combines in himself the dual office of being religious or spiritual head ofparticular cult or religious fraternity, and of the manager of secular properties of institution of Math.It also held that the principles noticed in the above cases would make it sufficiently clear that "amath is an institutional sanctum presided over by a superior who combines in himself the dual officeof being the religious or spiritual head of the particular cult or religious fraternity, and of themanager of the secular properties of the institution of the math."270. A "Math" is not a Temple inasmuch it is a place for rendering charitable and religious servicesin general. Merely there are idols in the Math, it cannot be treated as a 'Temple'. Similarly, anSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/114institution which is in its origin a Math, cannot be treated as a temple because idols are alsoworshipped in the Math. Math can not be treated as a place of public religious worship mere byreason of the worship of idols. The primary purpose of a 'Math' is to encourage and foster spirituallearning by maintenance of a competent line of teachers who impart religious instructions to thedisciples and followers of the Math and try to strengthen doctrines of particular school or order ofwhich they profess to be adherents. Deity or an idol may be an essential element in a 'Math' ifworship of a God in a certain form is an essential feature of religious doctrine of a certain order. Theworship of God in that form would be part of their religious teaching. It would be the duty of anyMath of that order to foster and encourage, otherwise it may not be necessary. This has been pointedout in 'Mukherjea's' Hindu Law (supra), 4th Edn. at page 331-332 as under :"...there are religious orders like those of the Shankara School which believe in monastic doctrines ofthe Vedanta and to not regard the worship of a personal God as a necessary or essential part of thereligious teachings. Even in Shankar Mutts, there may exist a shrine for a particular idol but itcannot be said that the presiding element in a Mutt must be a deity or that there cannot be a Muttwithout an idol. A shrine or a temple may ordinarily be seen as an adjunct to a Mutt, but it is not anecessary one and even when it exists, it is not the chief or the indispensable part of the institution.It is only ancillary to the main purpose for whicht he Mutt is endowed and the presiding element ina Mutt is always the Mohunt or the spiritual preceptor."271. A place of worship is not a necessary part of a Math, though it is often found in such institutionand although primarily intended for the use of inmates, the public may also be admitted to suchplaces of religious worship. (See Thamba Vs. Arundel I.L.R. 6 Mad. 287).272. The presiding element in a Math is an 'ascetic' or a religious teacher, who together with hisdisciples and co-disciples form spiritual family. It owes its existence to benefactions or grants ofproperty made by pious benefactors. The object of benefaction is the creation of an institution forthe benefit of a fraternity of religious men at the head of which stands the superior or Mahant (alsotermed as "Mohunt"), who represents the entire institution. (vide Satya Charan Sarkar Vs. MohantaRudrananda Giri AIR 1953 Cal. 716).273. In Shri Krishna Singh Vs. Mathura Ahir (supra), Court also quoted the relevant extracts fromMukherjea's Hindu Law (supra) as to what a "Math" would signify. It further held that the propertybelong to a Math is in fact attached to the office of Mahant, and passed by inheritance to no one whodoes not fill the office. The Head of a Math, as such, is not a trustee in the sense in which that termis generally understood, but in legal contemplation he has an estate for life in its permanentendowments and an absolute property in the income derived from the offerings of his followers,subject only to the "burden of maintaining the institution". He is bound to spend a large part ofincome derived from the offerings of his followers on charitable or religious objects.274. The words "the burden of maintaining the institution" must be understood to include themaintenance of Math, the support of its Head and his disciples and the performance of religious andother charities in connection with it, in accordance with usage.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/115275. According to Hindu jurisprudence, religious institutions such as a "Math" is treated a "juristicentity" with a legal personality capable of holding and acquiring property. The ownership ofproperty vests in the institution. From the very nature of Math, it can act and assert its rights onlythrough a human agency known as "Mahant", Shebait are Dharmakarta or sometimes known asTrustee. Court, in Shri Krishna Singh (supra), quoted following observations of Bombay High Court(Jenkins, C.J.) in Babajirao Vs. Laxmandas 1904 ILR 28 Bom. 215 at 223 with approval whichdefines true notion of a "Math" in the following terms :"A math, like an idol, is in Hindu law a judicial person capable of acquiring, holding and vindicatinglegal rights, though of necessity it can only act in relation to those rights through the medium ofsome human agency." (emphasis added)276. In H.H. Shri Swamiji of Shri Amar Mutt and others Vs. Commissioner, Hindu Religious andCharitable Endowments Department and others 1979 (4) SCC 642, Hon'ble P.N. Shinghal, J., in aseparate judgment, though concurring with the conclusion of majority view of Constitution Bench,in para 47 observed "A Mutt is a monastic institution for the use and benefit of ascetics belonging toa particular order presided over by a superior who is its religious teacher. The Mutt property, thoughoriginally given by a donor, belongs to that spiritual family represented by the superior or Mahant.It does not, however, vest in him, as he is some sort of a "shebait", and vests in the Mutt as a juristicperson." (emphasis added)277. The term "Mahant" has been described in 'Law Lexicon-The Encyclopaedic Law Dictionary byP. Ramanatha' (supra), on page 1161 as under:"Mahant. (H.) The head of a religious establishment of the medicant orders of the Hindus. (Wil.Gloss. 317.) A Mahant or the head of a Math is not a "trustee" in the sense in which that term isunderstood in English law. The only law as to a Mahant and his office, functions and duties, is to befound in custom and practice, which is to be proved by testimony. But though a Mahant is not atrustee, in the English sense, he is, in view of the obligations and duties resting on him, answerable,as a trustee in the general sense, for the proper administration of the institution of which he is thehead. The existence of a very wide discretion in the Mahant as to the application of the income of theMath or asthal is by no means inconsistent with a fiduciary obligation so to manage the property ofthe Math that the objects for which the Math exists shall be effectively serve. (Kesho Das v. AmarDasji and others, 14 Pat 379=156 IC 1093=8 RP 62=16 Pat LT 35=AIR 1935 Pat 111)" (emphasisadded)278. The position of a "Mahant" of a "Math" is like that of a "Head of the institution". He is neither acorporation nor a life tenant in respect of Math property. He is also not a trustee in the sense inwhich the term is understood in English law. Call by whatever name, he is the manager or custodianof the institution. The property which he holds does not vest in him; it vests in the institution and isheld by him as a Manager of the same. [See Vidya varyathi Vs. Baluswami (Supra)].279. In Krishna Singh Ahir (supra) regarding succession of Mahantship of a Math or religiousinstitution, Court said:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/116"30. The law is well settled that succession to mahantship of a math or religious institution isregulated by custom or usage of the particular institution, except where a rule of succession is laiddown by the founder himself who created the endowment. See: Genda Puri v. Chatar Puri (1886) 13Ind App 100 (PC); Sital Das v. Sant Ram AIR 1954 SC 606 and Mahalinga Thambiran v. La SriKasivasi (1974) 2 SCR 74." (emphasis added)280. According to usage, wide discretion in the application of funds of institution is possessed by"Mahant" but it is always subject to certain obligations and duties equally prescribed by customsand usages.281. We may also refer to one more aspect of a Math, i.e., public and private Maths. B.K. Mukherjeain Hindu law (supra) has discussed about such Maths and observed that there can be a private Mathdepending upon the construction of grant, customs and usage of the institution etc. However, it hasfurther observed, where the body is created for the benefit of public generally, Math is dedicated forthe use of ascetics generally, such Math would be regarded as public institution. Maths havegenerally Sadavrats or arrangement for feeding and giving shelter to wayfarers and ascetics attachedto them. They may also have Temples to which the public is allowed access. Such circumstancesmight indicate public character of endowment but nevertheless it is probable to have a private Mathwhere endowment is not intended to confer benefit upon the public generally or even upon themembers of a particular religious sect or order.282. So far as phrase "religious denomination" is concerned, we find that it has attained significancefor use in Articles 26 and 27 of Constitution. In order to understand the expression 'religiousdenomination', we have to understand both the expressions, namely, 'religion' and 'denomination'.283. Obviously, the words 'religion', 'denomination' and "religious denomination" are not defined inthe Constitution, though they occur in Articles 15 (1), 15 (2), 16 (2), 16 (5), 23 (2), 25 to 28, 29 (2)and 30. In order to understand their scope, it would be useful to refer aforesaid provisions as under :15. (1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste,sex, place of birth or any of them.(2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, besubject to any disability,liability, restriction or condition with regard to-(a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and place of public entertainment; or(b) the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and place of public resort maintained wholly orpartly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public.16. (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residenceor any of them, be ineligible for, or discriminated against in respect of, any employment or officeunder the State.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/117(5) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any law which provides that the incumbent ofan office in connection with the affairs of any religious or denominational institution or any memberof the governing body thereof shall be a person professing a particular religion or belonging to aparticular denomination.23. (2) Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from imposing compulsory service for publicpurposes, and in imposing such service the State shall not make any discrimination on grounds onlyof religion, race, caste or class or any of them.25. (1) Subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, allpersons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice andpropagate religion.(2) Nothing in this article shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the State frommaking any law-(a) regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may beassociated with religious practice;(b) providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of apublic character to all classes and sections of Hindus.26. Subject to public order, morality and health, every religious denomination or any section thereofshall have the right-(a) to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes;(b) to manage its own affairs in matter of religion;(c) to own and acquire movable and immovable property; and(d) to administer such property in accordance with law.27. No person shall be compelled to pay any taxes, the proceeds of which are specificallyappropriated in payment of expenses for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion orreligious denomination.28. (1) No religious instruction shall be provided in any educational institution wholly maintainedout of State funds.(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall apply to an educational institution which is administered by the Statebut has been established under any endowment or trust which requires that religious instructionshall be imparted in such institution.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/118(3) No person attending any educational institution recognised by the State or receiving aid out ofState funds shall be required to take part in any religious instruction that may be imparted in suchinstitution or to attend any religious worship that may be conducted in such institution or in anypremises attached thereto unless such person or, if such person is a minor, his guardian has givenhis consent thereto.29. (2) No citizen shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the Stateor receiving aid out of State funds on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language or any of them.30. (1) All minorities, whether based on religion or language, shall have the right to establish andadminister educational institutions of their choice.(2) The State shall not, in granting aid to educational institutions, discriminate against anyeducational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority, whether basedon religion or language. (emphasis added)284. Religion is certainly a matter of faith of individuals or communities. Religion has its basis in asystem of beliefs or doctrine which are regarded by those, who profess that religion, are conducive totheir spiritual well being, but it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else but adoctrine or belief. A religion may not only lay down a code of ethical rules for its followers to accept,it might prescribe rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship which are regarded asintegral part of religion and these forms and observances might extend even to matters of food anddress.285. The expression "religion" has been defined in the "Words and Phrases", Permanent Edition,Vol. 36-A, page 461-463 and onwards, and reads as under :"The terms 'religion' and 'religious' in ordinary usage are not rigid concepts.'Religion' has reference to one's views of his relations to his Creator and to the obligations theyimpose of reverence for his being and character and of obedience to his will."The word 'religion' in its primary sense (from 'religare' to rebind-bind back), imports as applied tomoral questions, only a recognition of a conscious duly to obey restraining principles of conduct. Insuch sense we suppose there is no one who will admit that he is without religion."'religion' is bond uniting man to God and virtue whose purpose is to render God worship due himas source of all being and principle of all government of things."'Religion' has reference to man's relation to divinity to the moral obligation of reverence andworship.

Belief in a superhuman power and suchan adjustment of human activities to the requirements of that power as may enable the individualbeliever to exist more happily is common to all 'religions'. The term 'religion' has reference to one'sviews on his relations to his Creator, and to the obligations they impose on reverence for His beingand character and obedience to his will."The term 'religion' has reference to one's view of his relations to his Creator, and to the obligationsthey impose of reverence for his being and character, and of obedience to his will. With obligationshe may think they impose, and the manner in which an expression shall be made by him of his beliefon those subjects, no interference can be permitted, provided always the law of society designed tosecure its peace and prosperity, and the morals of its people, are not interfered with."286. In Corpus Juris Secundum Vol. LXXVI (1952), pages 727-729, word "religion" has beendescribed as under:"RELIGION. The word "religion" is derived from "religare," meaning to rebind, to bind back; and inits most general sense it means devotion or fidelity, as to a principle or practice; scrupulousconformity; conscientiousness; deep attachment like that felt for an object of worship.There is not complete agreement on a definition of the word "religion" as it is used in the theologicalsense, and the content of the term is found in the history of the human race and is incapable ofcompression into a few words. It is not defined in the Bible or in various state constitutions, andalthough the word is used in the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, seeConstitutional Law Â§ 206 a, it is not defined in the Constitution, and it is therefore necessary to goelsewhere to ascertain the meaning of the term, and it has been said that there is nowhere to gomore appropriately than to the history of the times in the midst of which the Bill of Rights of thefederal Constitution was adopted.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/120What has been referred to as a "minimum definition" of the word "religion" as stated by a legalphilosopher is that the term "religion" has reference to one's views of his relations to his Creator,and to the obligations they impose of reverence for His being and character, and of obedience to Hiswill.As stated by a religious philosopher, religion is squaring human life with superhuman life, and whatis common to all religions is belief in a superhuman power and an adjustment of human activities tothe requirements of that power, such adjustment as may enable the individual believer to exist morehappily.As generally accepted, "religion" may be defined as a bond uniting man to God and a virtue whosepurpose is to render God the worship due to him as the source of all being and the principle of allgovernment of things; the recognition of God as an object of worship, love, and obedience; theservice and adoration of God or a god as expressed in forms of worship, in obedience to divinecommands, especially as found in accepted sacred writings or as declared by recognized teachersand in the pursuit of a way of life regarded as incumbent on true believers; an apprehension,awareness, or conviction of the existence of a Supreme Being, or, more widely, of supernaturalpowers or influences controlling one's own, humanity's, or nature's destiny; also, such asapprehension, etc., accompanied by or arousing reverence, love, gratitude, the will to obey and serveand the like; religious experience or insight; often, specifically, the awakening of religious belief,convictions, etc., as in conversion; a belief in an invisible superhuman power, or powers, conceivedof after the analogy of the human spirit, on which, or whom, man regards himself as dependent, andto which, or whom, he thinks himself in some degree responsible, together with the feelings andpractices which naturally flow from such a belief; some system of faith and practice resting on theidea of the existence of one God, the creator and ruler, to whom His creatures owe obedience andlove. More specifically, the word "religion" is understood to mean conformity in faith and life to theprecepts inculcated in the Bible, respecting conduct of life and duty toward God and man; theChristian faith and practice.The essence of religion is belief in a relation to God involving duties superior to those arising fromany human relation, and it includes a way of life as well as beliefs on the nature of the world. In itsbroadest sense "religion" comprehends all systems of belief in the existence of being superior to, andcapable to exercising an influence for good or evil on, the human race, and all forms of worship ofservice intended to influence or give honor to such superior powers; any system of faith andworship; morality with a sanction drawn from a future state of rewards and punishment." (emphasisadded)287. Black's Law Dictionary, Seventh Edition, page 1293 describe it as under:"religion. A system of faith and worship usu. involving belief in a supreme being and usu. containinga moral or ethical code; esp., such a system recognized and practiced by a particular church, sect, ordenomination. In construing the protections under the Establishment Clause and the Free ExerciseClause, courts have interpreted the term religion quite broadly to include a wide variety of theisticand nontheistic beliefs."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/121288. Law Lexicon-The Encyclopaedic Law Dictionary by P. Ramanatha Aiyer (supra) describe"religion" at page 1646-1647 as under:"Religion. (Religio). Virtue, as founded on reverence of God, and Expectation of future rewards andpunishments; a system of Divine Faith and Worship as opposed to others. (Johns) That habit ofreverence towards the Divine Nature, whereby we are enabled and inclined to serve and worshiphim, after such a manner as we conceive most acceptable to him, is called Religion. (Tomlins LawDic.) "What is Religion? Is it not what a man honestly believes in an approves of and thinks it is dutyto inculcate on others, whether with regard to this world or the next? A belief in any system ofretribution by an overruling power. It must, I think include the principle of gratitude to an activepower who can confer blessings" (per Willes, J., Baxter v. Langley, 38 LJMC 5).In all countries the word "religion" is ordinarily understood to mean some system of faith andpractice resting on the idea of the existence of one God, the creator and ruler, to whom his creaturesowe obedience and love.Religion is morality, with a sanction drawn from a future state of rewards and punishments.The word "religion" in its primary sense imports, as applied to moral questions, only a recognition ofa conscious duty to obey restraining principles of conduct. In such sense we suppose there is no onewho will admit that he is without religion.By the generic word "religion" is not meant the Christian religion or Bible religion, but it means thereligion of man, and not the religion of any class of men."I for one would never be a party, unless the law were clear, to saying to any man who put forwardhis views on those most sacred things, that he should be branded as apparently criminal because hediffered from the majority of mankind in his religious views or convictions on the subject of religion.If that were so, we should get into ages and times which, thank God, we do not live in, when peoplewere put to death for opinions and beliefs which now almost all of us believe to be true."--[LordColeridge, C.J., Reg. v. Bradlaugh and others, (1883) 15 Cox.

It primarily involves some immediateconsciousness of transcendent realities of supreme personal worth vitally influencing life andthought, expressing themselves in forms which are conditioned by the entire stage of developmentreached by the individual and his environments and tending to become more explicit and static inmythologies, theologies, philosophies and scientific doctrines. Ramanasramam v. Commissioner forHindu Religions and Charitable Endowments, AIR 1961 Mad 265 (269).Religion is concerned with man's relations with God. If reason leads people not to acceptChristianity or any known religion, but they do believe in the excellence of qualities such as truth,beauty and love, or believe in the Platonic concept of the ideal, their beliefs may be to them theequivalent of a religion, but viewed objectively they are not religion, Barralet v. Attorney General,(1980) 3 All ER 918 (924)."289. In New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary of the English Language Deluxe Encyclopedic Edition,page 841, define "religion":"re-li-gion n. man's expression of his acknowledgment of the divine, a system of beliefs and practicesrelating to the sacred and uniting its adherents in a community, e.g. Judaism, Christianity,adherence to such a system, a man without religion, something which has a powerful hold on aperson's way of thinking, interests etc."290. In Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras Vs. Sri Lakshmindra ThirthaSwamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt AIR 1954 SC 282, Court in para 17 said:"17.......Religion is certainly a matter of faith with individuals or communities and it is notnecessarily theistic. There are well known religions in India like Buddhism and Jainism which donot believe in God or in any Intelligent First Cause. A religion undoubtedly has its basis in a systemof belief or doctrines which are regarded by those who profess that religion as conductive to theirspiritual well being, but it would not be correct to say that religion is nothing else but a doctrine orbelief.

It has its outward expression in acts as well.Religious practices or performances of acts in pursuance of religious belief are as much a part ofreligion as faith or belief in particular doctrines. Thus if the tenets of the Jain or the Parsi religionlay down that certain rites and ceremonies are to be performed at certain times and in a particularmanner, it cannot be said that these are secular activities partaking of commercial or economiccharacter simply because they involve expenditure of money or employment of priests or the use ofmarketable commodities.

Another Constitution Bench in S.P. Mittal Vs.

In S.P. Mittal (supra) , Court also held:"'Religion' is morality, with a sanction drawn from a future state of rewards and punishments. Theterm 'religion' and 'religious' in ordinary usage are not rigid concepts. 'Religion' has reference toone's views of his relations to his Creator and to the obligations they impose of reverence for hisbeing and character, and of obedience to his will. The word 'religion' in its primary sense (from'religare', to rebind, bind back), imports, as applied to moral questions, only recognition of aconscious duty to obey restraining principles of conduct. In such sense we suppose there is no onewho will admit that he is without religion. Religion is bond-uniting man to God, and virtue whosepurpose is to render God worship due him as source of all being and principle of all government ofthings. 'Religion' has reference to man's relation to divinity; to the moral obligation of reverence andworship, obedience, and submission. It is the recognition of God as an object of worship, love andobedience; right feeling toward God, as highly apprehended. 'Religion' means the service andadoration of God or a god as expressed in forms of worship; an apprehension, awareness, orconviction of the existence of a Supreme Being; any system of faith, doctrine and worship, as theChristian religion, the religions of the Orient; a particular system of faith or worship. While 'religion'in its broadest sense includes all forms of belief in the existence of superior beings capable ofexercising power over the human race, as commonly accepted it means the formal recognition ofGod, as members of societies and associations, and the term, 'a religious purpose', as used in theconstitutional provision exempting from taxation property used for religious purposes, means theuse of property by a religious society or body of persons as a place for pubic worship. 'Religion' issquaring human life with superhuman life. Belief on a superhuman power and such an adjustmentof human activities to the requirements of that power as may enable the individual believer to existmore happily is common to all 'religions'. The term 'religion' has reference to one's views of hisrelations to his Creator, and to the obligations they impose of reverence for his being and character,and of obedience to his will. With man's relations to his Maker and the obligations he may thinkthey impose, and the manner in which he of his belief on those subjects shall make an expression, nointerference can be permitted, provided always the laws of society, designed to secure its peace andprosperity, and the morals of its people, are not interfered with."294. In Most Rev. P.M.A. Metropolitan and others Vs. Moran Mar Marthoma and another, 1995(Supple) (4) SCC 286, word 'religion' was described as under:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/124"Religion" is the belief, which binds spiritual nature of men to supernatural being.

Narayana Deekshitulu Vs. State of A.P. and others, 1996(9) SCC 548, Court described"religion" with reference to Articles 25 and 26 of the Constitution as under:"'Religion' as used in these articles must be construed in its strict and etymological sense. 'Religion'is that which binds a man with his Cosmos, his Creator or Super force. It is difficult and ratherimpossible to define or delimit the expressions 'religion' or "matters of religion' used in Article 25and 26. Essentially, religion is a matter of personal faith and belief of personal relations of anindividual with what he regards as Cosmos, his maker or his creator, which, he believes, regulatesthe existence of insentient beings and the forces of the universe. 'Religion' is not necessarily theisticand in fact there are well-known religions in India itself like Buddhism and Jainism, which do notbelieve in the existence of God. In India, Muslims believe in Allah and have faith in Islam; Christiansin Christ and Christianity; Parsis is Zoroastrianism; Sikhs in Guru Granth Sahib and teachings ofGuru Nanak Devji, its founder, which is a facet of Hinduism like Brahmo Samaj, Arya Samaj etc. Areligion undoubtedly has its basis in a system of beliefs and doctrine, which are regarded by thosewho profess religion to be conducive to their spiritual well being. A religion is not merely an opinion,doctrine or belief. It has outward expression in acts as well."296. In T.K. Gopal alias Gopi Vs. State of Karnataka, 2000 (6) SCC 168, Court said:"'Religion' is a matter of faith stemming from the depth of the heart and mind. 'Religion' is a belief,which binds the spiritual nature of man to a supernatural being; it is an object of conscientiousdevotion, faith and pietism. Devotion in its fullest sense is a consecration and denotes an act ofworship. Faith in the strict sense constitutes firm reliance on the truth of religious doctrines in everysystem of religion. Religion, faith or devotion is not easily interchangeable."297. In Ms. Aruna Roy and others Vs. Union of India and others, JT 2002 (7) SC 103 it was said:"The word 'religion' has different shades and colours. Important shade is dharma (duty), that is tosay, duty towards the society and the soul. It should not be misunderstood nor contention could beraised that as it is used in the national policy of education, secularism would be at peril."298. In P.M.A. Metropolitan (supra), Court in respect of faith and belief also observed:"Religion isfounded on faith and belief. Faith emanates from conscience and belief is result of teaching andlearning." (para 3)299. The word "denomination" has been described in Black's Law Dictionary Seventh Edition onpage 446 as under:"denomination. 1. An act of naming. 2.

In Sri Adi Visheshwara of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi and others Vs. State of U.P. andothers, 1997(4) SCC 606 Court said:"On the practices of the Math, the meaning of the connotation "denomination" in that behalf, it washeld that each such sect or special sects which are founded by their organizer generally by name becalled a religious denomination as it is designated by distinctive name in many cases. It is the nameof the founder and has common faith and common spiritual organization. Article 26 of theConstitution contemplates not merely a religious denomination but also a section thereof. Thewords "religious denomination" under Article 26 of the Constitution must take their colour from theword religion and if this be so the expression religious denomination must be (1) a collection ofreligious faith, a system of belief, which is conducive to the spiritual well-being, i.e, a common faith;(2) Common organization; (3) a designation by a distinctive name."305.

The word "religious denomination or religious sect" has been described in Words and PhrasesPermanent Edition Vol. 36A (1962) on page 479:"A religious sect is a body or number of persons united in tenets, but constituting a distinctorganization or party, by holding sentiments or doctrines different from those of other sects orpeople.

Everysuch sect is "sectarian," and a "church" is an organization for religious purposes or for the publicworship of God. Benett v. City of La Grange, 112 S.E. 482, 485, 153 Ga. 428, 22 A.L.R. 1312."307. The term "religious sect" is described in the Law Lexicon-The Encyclopaedic Law Dictionary byP. Ramanatha Aiyer (supra) at page 1648 as under:"Religious sect. "People believing in the same religious doctrines, who are more or less closelyassociated or organized to advance such doctrines and increase the number of believers therein,"constitute a religious sect. A religious sect is a body or number of persons united in tenets, butconstituting a distinct organization or party, by holding sentiments or doctrines different from thoseof other sects or people."308. In New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary of the English Language Deluxe Encyclopedic Edition atpage 841 the word "religious" has been described as under:"re-li-gious 1. adj. of, pertaining to, or concerned with religion, faithful in religion, associated withthe practice of religion, a religious rite (of behavior) governed by principles adhered to as strictly asif they were those of a religion, a religious regard for accuracy, of or pertaining to a monastic order2. pl. re-li-gious n. someone who has made monastic vows."309. The term "religious denomination" came up for consideration in Sri Shirur Mutt (Supra) andafter referring to Oxford Dictionary, Court observed that the meaning of "religious denomination" isa collection of individuals classed together under the same name; a religious sect or body having acommon faith and organization and designated by a distinctive name. Court held that different sectsor sub-sects can certainly be called a religious denomination as it is designated by a distinctivename, has a common faith and common spiritual organization.310. In S.P. Mittal (supra), Court also considered the term 'religious denomination' and said:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/128"The word 'religious denomination' in Article 26 of the Constitution must take their colour from theword 'religion' and if this be so, the expression 'religious denomination' must also satisfy threeconditions". It must be a collection of individuals who have a system of beliefs or doctrines, whichthey regard as conducive to their spiritual well being, that is, a common faith; Commonorganization; and Designation by a distinctive name."311. In S. R. Bommai and others Vs. Union of India and others AIR 1994 SC 1918 and M/sRadhasoami Satsang, Saomi Bagh, Agra Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax 1992 (1) SCC 659 theaforesaid tests for determination of "religious denomination" were reiterated.312. In Nallor Marthandam Vellalar and others Vs. Commissioner, Hindu Religious and CharitableEndowments and others 2003 (10) SCC 712, it was held that the words "religious denomination"take their colour from the word "religion". Court further said that the expression "religiousdenomination" must satisfy three requirements- (1) it must be collection of individuals, who have asystem of beliefs or doctrine which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well-being, i.e. acommon faith, (2) a common organization; and (3) designation of a distinctive name. It necessarilyfollows that the common faith of the community should be based on religion in that they shouldhave common religious tenets and basic cord which connects them, should be religion and notmerely consideration of caste of community or social status.313. Following the view taken with regard to "religious denomination" in Sri Shirur Mutt (supra), athree-Judge Bench in Acharya Jagdishwaranand Avadhuta and others Vs. Commissioner of Police,Calcutta and another 1983 (4) SCC 522 held that "Ananda Marg", which is a collection of individualswho have a system of beliefs which they regard as conducive to their spiritual well being; a commonorganization; a definite name could be regard as a "religious denomination" within Hindu religionas it satisfies the test laid down by the Constitution Bench in Sri Shirur Mutt (supra).314. In Bramchari Sidheswar Shai (supra), Court held that Ram Krishna Mission is also a "religiousdenomination", and while expressing so, Court in para 51 of judgment said :"51. No good reason is shown to us for not accepting the view of the Division Bench of the point thatRamakrishna Mission or Ramakrishna Math is a religious denomination. It is not in dispute andcannot be disputed that Sri Ramakrishna could be regarded as religious teacher who expounded,practised and preached the principles of Vedanta on which Hindu religion is founded, to meet thechallenges posed to humanity in the changing world and made his disciples to spread the principlesso expounded by him not only in India but all over the world as the basic principles of Hinduism. Itcannot also be disputed that the disciples of Ramakrishna formed Ramakrishna Math andRamakrishna Mission for propagation and promotion of the principles, so expounded, practised andpreached by Ramakrishna Parmahansa, by way of publications and building of temples, prayer hallsand building of educational, cultural and charitable institutions as performance of sevas resulting inthe coming up of organisations as Ramakrishna Maths and Ramakrishna Missions, all over theworld. These Maths and Missions of Ramakrishna composed of the followers of principles ofHinduism as expounded, preached or practised by Ramakrishna as his disciples or otherwise form acult or sect of Hindu religion. They believe in the birth of sage Ramakrishna in Dakshineswar as anSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/129Avatar of Rama and Krishna and follow the principles of Hinduism discovered, expounded,preached and practised by him as those conducive to their spiritual well-being as the principles ofhighest Vedanta which surpassed the principles of Vedanta conceived and propagated bySankaracharya, Madhavacharya and Ramanunjacharya, who were earlier exponents of Hinduism.Hence, as rightly held by the Division Bench of the High Court, followers of Ramakrishna, who are acollection of individuals, who adhere to a system of beliefs as conducive to their spiritual wellbeing,who have organised themselves collectively and who have an organisation of definite name asRamakrishna Math or Ramakrishna Mission could, in our view, be regarded as a religiousdenomination within Hindu religion, inasmuch as they satisfy the tests laid down by this Court inSri Shirur Math's case (AIR 1954 SC 282) (supra) for regarding a denomination as a religiousdenomination."315. It may be noticed at this stage the scope of judicial review about what constitutes 'religiousbelief' or what is essential religious practices or what rites and ceremonies are essential according tothe tenets of a particular religion, is not subject to the belief or faith of a judge but once it is foundthat a belief, faith, rite or ceremony is genuinely and consciously treated to be part of profession orpractice of a religion by the segment of people of distinct group, believing in that particular religion,suffice it to constitute "religion" within the term of Article 25 of the Constitution whereunder thepersons of the said segment have a fundamental right to practice their religion without anyinterruption from State. This right is subject only to public order, morality and health and to theother provisions of Part III of the Constitution as well as the power of the State to make laws inrespect of the matter provided in Article 25(2) of the Constitution. This right is conferred to thepersons professing, practising and propagating the concerned religion.316. In Jamshed Ji Vs. Soonabai, (1909) 22 Bom 122 Hon'ble Davar, J., in respect of the belief of acommunity regarding 'religion' observed:"If this is the belief of the community and it is proved undoubtedly to be the belief of the Zoroastriancommunity,-a secular Judge is bound to accept that belief-it is not for him to sit in judgement onthat belief, he has no right to interfere with the conscience of a donor who makes a gift in favour ofwhat he believes to be the advancement of his religion and the welfare of his community ormankind."317. The above view has been quoted with approval in Ratilal Panachand Gandhi (supra) and inBijoe Emmanuel and others Vs. State of Kerala and others, 1986(3) SCC 615 wherein after quotingthe above observation, Court approved the same in the following words:"We do endorse the view suggested by Davar J.'s observation that the question is not whether aparticular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief isgenuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of religion. Our personalviews and reactions are irrelevant. If the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held it attracts theprotection of Article 25 but subject, of course, to the inhibitions contained therein." (emphasisadded)Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/130318. The contents and scope of Articles 25 and 26 of Constitution have been considered in a numberof decisions and it would be suffice to refer a Constitution Bench decision in Sardar Syedna TahelSaifuddin Saheb Vs. State of Bombay, AIR 1962 SC 853 wherein, referring to its earlier decisions, inpara 34, Court observed:"The content of Arts. 25 and 26 of the Constitution came up for consideration before this Court in1954 SCR 1005: (AIR 1954 S.C. 282), Ramanuj Das v. State of Orissa, 1954 SCR 1046: (AIR 1954 SC400), 1958 SCR 895: (AIR 1958 S.C. 255); (Civil Appeal No. 272 of 1960 D/- 17-3-1961: (AIR 1961SC 1402), and several other cases and the main principles underlying these provisions have by thesedecisions been placed beyond controversy. The first is that the protection of these articles is notlimited to matters of doctrine or belief, they extend also to acts done in pursuance of religion andtherefore contain a guarantee for rituals and observances, ceremonies and modes of worship whichare integral parts of religion. The second is that what constitutes an essential part of a religion orreligious practice has to be decided by the courts with reference to the doctrine of a particularreligion and include practices which are regarded by the community as a part of its religion."319. Here referring as to what constitute "religious denomination", Court also observed that theidentity of a "religious denomination" consists in the identity of its doctrine, creeds and tenets andthese are intended to ensure unity of the faith which its adherents profess and the identity ofreligious views and bonds of union which binds them together as one community. In the absence ofconformity to essentials, the denomination would not be an entity cemented into solidity byharmonious uniformity of opinion, it would be a mere incongruous heap of, as it were, grains ofsand, thrown together without being united, each of these intellectual and isolated grains differingfrom every other, and the whole forming nominally united while really unconnected mass; fraughtwith nothing but internal dissimilitude, and mutual and reciprocal contradiction and dissension.(This is a quote from the passage of Lord Halsbury in Free Church of Scotland Vs. Overtoun; 1904AC 515 which in turn refer to the observations of "Smith B." in Dill Vs. Watson, (1836) 2 Jones Rep.(Ir Ex) 48).320. Court further observed that a denomination within Article 26 and persons who are members ofthat denomination are under Article 25 entitled to ensure continuity of denomination and suchcontinuity is possible only by maintaining bond of religious discipline which would secure thatcontinued adherence of its members to certain essentials like faith, doctrine, tenets and practices.The right guaranteed by Article 25(1) is not confined to freedom of conscience in the sense of theright to hold a belief and to propagate that belief, but includes right to the practice of religion, theconsequences of that practice must also bear the same complexion and be the subject of a likeguarantee.321. In Sardar Sarup Singh and others Vs. State of Punjab and others, AIR 1959 SC 860 anotherConstitution Bench observed that freedom of religion in our Constitution is not confined to religiousbeliefs only but extends to essential religious practices as well subject to the restriction which theConstitution has laid down. Referring to Shirur Mutt (supra) it also held that a religiousdenomination or organization enjoys complete autonomy in the matter of deciding as to what ritesand ceremonies are essential according to the tenets of the religion they hold. Similarly referring toSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/131Venkataramana Devaru Vs. State of Mysore, AIR 1958 SC 255 the court said that matters of religionin Article 26(b) include practices essential according to the community as part of its religion.(d) About Mathamnaya-Mahanushasan322. It is in the context of above discussion, issue relating to status of instructions contained in"Mathamnaya Mahanushasan" has to be examined , whether constitute established customs andusages having force of law in respect of religious denomination, with which we are concerned, i.e.whether with respect to Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth established by Adi Shankaracharya, any customand usage, otherwise than the written instructions contained in the above books of command, hasbeen proved by any of parties so as to prevail over the instructions contained in aforesaid books ofcommand.323. Though plaintiff has claimed that Mathamnaya and Mahanushasan are the books containingcommands of Adi Shankaracharya, governing four Peethas established by him which are called"Amnaya" (teaching of Vedas) and Peetham (seats of teaching of Vedas) and in written statementappellant has said that these are not mandatory commands but only recommendatory but duringevidence it has been admitted by several witnesses of both parties that these books containcommands of high degree of reverence and they have been followed traditionally in all the fourPeethas strictly and must be observed.324. Plaintiff said that "Mahanushasanam", is the book of Law which has been left by AdiShankaracharya, founder of Shardamath-Dwarka, Goverdhanmath-Puri, Shringerimath-Shringerand Jyotirmath Badarikashram for proper governance and functioning thereof. This sacred book is awritten Constitution of said four Peeths/Maths established by Adi Shankaracharya.325.

Here Acharya Shankar has given testimony of the Revelation, "Shvetasvatar Upanishad" whichsays; 'Who has as much steadfast faith and unartificial devotion in the Spiritual master as inselfuminous Supreme Lord, only that great soul can realize the substance of the aforesaidinstruction'. After quoting this verse of "Svetashvatar Upanishad" in his commentary on Vis.'Sahasranam", Acharya says thus it is also proved by the hymn of Svetashvatar Upanishad. That oneshould have excellent supreme devotion in the Supreme Self (Sri Hari) and in the Spiritual Master(ibid Comm. Onverse 14/Name 1). Hence there is command of Acharya Shankar that each of thefour Acharyas ascended on his aforesaid four seats respectively must be known as 'Acharya' Shankarhimself i.e. an incarnation of Acharya Shankar. In this verse as also in other verses of this Commandthe word 'Parivard' means "Paramhams Parivajak" i.e. excellent Renouncer who excels all fourstages of life, because only such types of Renouncers are entitled for being initiated with "GreatMotto".

Abhishek is a Vedic religious ritual, whereby Rulers of Dharma, Gods, Men, etc. are appointed.By way of Abhishek, a reigning Shankaracharya of any of four Vedic Peethas of Adi Shankaracharyaimbibes divine powers of Adi Shankaracharya in the qualified Renouncer and thereby grants himstatus to attain Shankaracharyaship, which status confers upon consecrated person, capacity toacquire majesty of Shankaracharya and ascend on the seat of Adi Shankaracharya by attainingGodship.333. According to Rigved's Aitereya, Brahman Abhishekam is always done by the superior. In oldendays, Prajapati sprinkled (consecrated) Indra, Soma the king, Varuna, Yama, Manu.334. Following command in Verse 55 (supra), king Sudhanva had issued a Charter i.e. Firman orKing's writ being dated Udhisthir Era 2663 Ashwin Shukla 15 wherefrom it becomes clear that 1stset of four Acharyas of four Monasteries established by Adi Shankaracharya were Yogi, Sarvajnaand, Adi Shankaracharya had appointed them by way of consecrating each of them on theirrespective Math. Relevant portion of sad Charter reads as follows:" On the prayer of the entire world, prominent Brahmins, Kshatriyas etc. like us, (Bhagwatpad) dulyestablished four Dharm Capitals in the name of Goverdhan, Jyotir, Sharda and Shringerimonasteries in the realm of Jagannath, Badari, Dwarka and Shring-Rishi; there with the consent ofours, the people, installed by consecrating- Sri Totak alias Pratardanacharya on Jyotir-Math forprotecting distinct laws of Dharm easily owing to Superiority of the yogis in the north, Prithvidharalias Hastmalakacharya in the Ashram of Rishi Shring who is of his similar nature; Padampad aliasSanandanacharya in Bhogvardhan who has his own view in the considered subject as also isSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/136omniscient in spite of being hot natured; Vishwaroop alias Sureshwaracharya world famous inwordily and Vedic systems, reputed, manifestation of omniscient on Sharda peeth Dwarka . . .Installing the four Acharyas in the four directions of Bharatvarsh (Bhagvatpad) commanded them toprotect their own realms according to distinct law of their monasteries and illuminate the VeidicPath. We the Brahmins and the Kashatriya, the inhabitants of those realms should abide by theinstructions imparted by the Acharyas, the Lords of those realms..... we every one born in Brahminand Kashatriya clans bounded in rules according to the command of Bhagvatpad accept itgracefully:335. Sudhanva was the king of Mahismati, which is presently known as Maheshwar in State ofMadhya Pradesh. In the Genealogical list of Chahman Dynasty reproduced by historian 'ShyamalDas' in his book " History of Mewar" published in the year 1886, king Sudhanva comes at serial no.6. In the said list, first king is Chahman and 41st king is Vasudev. Another historian 'Dr. DasarathSharma' has produced another list of Chahman Dynasty on the basis of available stone and copperplate inscriptions of kings of said Dynasty starting from the aforesaid king Vasudev. According tothis Genealogical list great emperor Prithviraj Chahman is the king of 22nd generation of VasudevDytnasty.336. After amalgamation of these two lists, we find that King Sudhanva whose name has beenreferred by Adi Shankaracharya as 'contemporary ruler' in his book 'Mathamnaya' and'Mahanushasanam' comes on serial no. 6, King Vasudev comes on serial no.41 and PrithvirajChahman comes on serial no. 62.337. In the aforesaid verse it has been said that at the end of his rule, outgoing Shankaracharyashould install new Shankaracharya by way of consecration on concerned seat. In 'Vimarhs' writtenby 73rd Shankaracharya of Shardamath-Dwarka in the year 1896 AD, on page 25 to 28, anauthoritative reproduction of 9th Century's list of Acharya along with chronology of AcharyaShankar's life has been published, wherein, it has been mentioned that on three respective dateseach of 1st set of four Acharyas were consecrated on respective seats. Similar fact has been recordedin the Copper Plate of king Sudhanva dated back 475 B.C. Apart from this, 8th Century's narrativewhich has been reproduced in the book "Shankaracharya Charitram", on page 10 and 11, written byPandit Venkatachal Sharma of Mysore in the year 1914, also supports the facts of handing overpower of aforesaid four monasteries to 1st set of four Acharyas respectively by Acrharya Shankarhimself by way of consecration.338. Sri Manish Goel however submitted that Mahanushasan is not a work connected with books ofcommand and the word 'Setu' has been wrongly interpreted by Sri Mishra, counsel appearing forplaintiff. He pointed out that there are 110 Upnishads but Adi Shankaracharya in his ShankarBhasya has noted only 11 Upnishads. It is submitted that Adi Shakaracharya has simplified messageof Vedas, Upnishads and propagated thereof also in a simplified manner. The words and phrasesused in "Mathamnaya and Mahanushasan" must be understood in the light as to how AdiShankaracharya understood the same at the relevant time. He referred to "ShankaracharyaSarvasnam" a compilation of texts written by Adi Shankaracharya. According to it one has to followcommands like Sadacharanushasan. Sri Goel referred to verses 16, 6, 17, 44, 45, 52 in reference toSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/137words 'Sanyasi', 'Suchi', 'Vairagya', 'Gyan' 'Vigyan' and Brahmchari respectively. He also submittedthe term 'Sanyasi' must be understood in the manner used in Bhagwat Geeta, Chapter 18 Verse 1 i.e.'Tyag' and further Verses 4,5,7,9,10 and 11. He also pointed out that Mathamnaya-Mahanushasan,Eng. Edn., which is a commentary of Sri Mishra, there is a description of more than 26 slokas ofMathamnaya and Mahanushasan than shown in original. He also raised objection that there is noreference of said books in the plaint and reference thereof in amendment was also rejected, hencecontention with regard to those books of command cannot be looked into since pleadings are not inaccordance with Order 6 Rule 9 CPC. Therefore, entire case built up by plaintiff on the basis ofinstructions/commands contained in Mathamnaya and Mahanushasan is of no substance.339. This last contention is not correct. Reference of Mathamnaya and Mahanushasan, we findspecifically in the plaint and there is also assertion positively that appellant lacks suitability inqualification, prescribed in the said books. With regard to details of disqualification, facts have beenstated in replication and appellant had also filed an additional written statement after more than 10years of filing replication which was accepted by Court below. Therein he has also submitted replywith regard to various disqualifications and thereafter both parties have led evidence thereto.Therefore contention that pleadings with regard to aforesaid books is lacking in the plaint iscontrary to record.340. Further whether Adi Shankaracharya actually wrote Mathamnaya and Mahanushasan or not isa question of fact and having antiquity of atleast more than 1200 years, we find no sufficientmaterial to express any final opinion on this aspect but since even witnesses of appellants haveadmitted that they contains commands of Adi Shankaracharya (we will demonstrate evidence littlelater) it can be safely held these books of commands are continuing to hold field and followed for thelast several centuries. It is also not in dispute that they contain instructions regarding appointment,removal and management of four Amnaya Peethas established by Adi Shankaracharya. Therefore,there is no reason but to hold that instructions contained in the aforesaid books are establishedcustoms or usages having force of law operating and applicable to Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth andconcerned religious denomination with which we are concerned.

The qualifications and regulations are also seen in Mathamnaye Setu YatishwarDand Vidhanam and also find mention in Shankara Math Vimarsh religious text. (Paper no.-914 Ka,Page-634)342. In view of above discussion, we find it irrelevant 'whether instructions/commands contained inMathamnaya and Mahanushasan are mandatory or recommendatory, for the reason that theseinstructions satisfy the nature of customs or usages having force of law operating to governselection, appointment, removal of Shankaracharya of four Peethas established by AdiShankaracharya and management/regulation thereof. That being so, it is a law which substantiallyneed be observed. Any flagrant violation thereof would render particular act illegal having noconsequences in law. One of the important condition in respect thereof, we find, that evidenceadduced by both parties clearly prove, that in order to qualify for installation of Shankaracharya inthe aforesaid four Peethas, one must be a 'Sanyasi' (Dandi Sanyasi) having knowledge of Sanskritand well conversant in religious scriptures like Vedas, Puranas etc. Since this concept of 'Sanyasi' isone of the relevant issue with regard to qualification of appellant, we now propose to consider itsmeaning and also characteristics and ingredients of a 'Sanyasi'.(e) Sanyasi i.e. Ascetic- what is343. The concept of 'Sanyasi' is as old as the mankind and earliest one in this concept is said to beLord Shiva.344. A Sanyasi is a person who has crossed all worldly attachments. Mere wearing a saffron cloth orgrowing beard and moustaches or wandering here and there and staying in Temples or Mutts wouldnot confer a Sanyashood upon an individual. A Sanyasi must take a conscious decision to give up allworldly affairs. A person gets sanyas when he sheds the 'I', 'me' and 'mine' consciousness and vowsto selflessly strive for the betterment of society. A sanyasi is initiated into sanyasam at the initiativeof Guru and through strict rituals, practised since Vedic times. Sanyasam is said as ancient asanything, but in the context of Sanatan Dharma, we find continuity at least from the time of AdiShankaracharya. In our ancient historical epic 'Ramayana', we cannot forget changed Roop ofRavana as 'Sanyasi' to take away Seeta to Lanka. It cannot be said that in that Roop, Ravana actuallydepicted a true 'Sanyasi'. Traditionally, for the person living social life, he was defined to have fourSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/139stages and fourth stage was 'Sanyas'.345. A 'Sanyasi' is technically outside the social field. He is outside social divisions or categories, andits rules. He does not have any social bond as such, though he can raise his meal through acceptingalms and by attending people's houses as a guest. A sanyasi is not supposed to stay long in any singleplace, he should be continuously moving so that he is not attached to any person or place. This iswhy a sanyasi is, in fact, called "parivrajaka", one that roams and is never settled in a place. The goalof a sanyasi is liberation, and nothing else. He should have no desires, temptations, ambitions, otherthan liberation. In different schools of Sanyas, there may be a few different traditions and practices,but basic concept of Sanyas is common.346. Sri Manish Goel submitted that a Sanyasi need not be looked into the term of"Sanyasopnishad" since term "Sanyas" is also referred to in "Bhagvadgeeta" in different context.Chapter-5 verse-2, chapter-5 verse-4, chapter-6 verse-2 and chapter-18 verse-2 are the places whereterm "Sanyasi" or "Sanyas" has been used in terms of Tyag. We find that in the context, in totality ofterm, "Sanyasi", nothing is different but to renounce worldly desires, rewards of Karm etc.347. So far as word "Sanyas" is concerned, we find that it is also referred in "Bhiksuka Upanishad" ofSukla Yajurveda, "Naradaparivrajaka Upanishad" of Atharvanaveda, and "Aruneyi Upanishad" ofAtharva-veda.348. In Vishnu Purana, Chapter 9, four stages of life are mentioned as Brahmacharya, Grihastha,Vanaprastha and Sanyasa. Vanaprastha is treated to be a stage of preparation of Sanyas. It says,when the householder, after performing the acts incumbent on his condition, arrives at the declineof life, let him consign his wife to the care of his sons, and go himself to the forests. Let him theresubsist upon leaves, roots, and fruit; and suffer his hair and beard to grow, and braid the formerupon his brows; and sleep upon the ground: his dress must be made of skin or of KÃ¡a or Kuagrasses; he must bathe thrice a day; he must offer oblations to the gods and to fire, treat all thatcome to him with hospitality: he must beg alms, and present food to all creatures: he must anointhimself with such unguents as the woods afford; and in his devotional exercises he must beendurant of heat and cold. The sage who diligently follows these rules, leads the life of hermit orVÃ¡naprastha, consumes, like fire, all imperfections, and conquers for himself the mansions ofeternity. Let the unimpassioned man, relinquishing all affection for wife, children, and possessions,enter the fourth order. Let him forego the three objects of human existence, pleasure, wealth, andvirtue, whether secular or religious, and, indifferent to friends, be the friend of all living beings. Lethim, occupied with devotion, abstain from wrong in act, word, or thought, to all creatures, human orbrute; and equally avoid attachment to any. Let him reside but for one night in a village, and notmore than five nights at a time in a city; and let him so abide, that good-will, and not animosity, maybe engendered. Let him, for the support of existence, apply for alms at the houses of three firstcastes, at the time when fires have been extinguished, and people have eaten. Let the wanderingmendicant call nothing his own, and suppress desire, anger, covetousness, pride, and folly. The sagewho gives no cause for alarm to living beings need never apprehend any danger from them. Havingdeposited the sacrificial fire in his own person, the Brahman feeds the vital flame, with the butterthat is collected as alms, through the altar of his mouth; and by means of his spiritual fire heSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/140proceeds to his own proper abode. But the twice-born man, who seeks for liberation, and is pure ofheart, and whose mind is perfected by self-investigation, secures the sphere of BrahmÃ¡, which istranquil, and is as a bright flame that emits not smoke.349. In "Srimadabhagavata" also, we may look into certain characteristics of 'Sanyasi' in 7th Skandh,Chapter-13, Verses 2 to 10 as under:fcHk`;k||lkS okl% dkSuhukPNknua ije~A R;Dra u naMfyxknsjU;r~ fdfpnukifnAA2AA "A person inthe renounced order of life may try to avoid even a dress to cover himself.

To human society he should present himself like a restless child, andalthough he is the greatest thoughtful orator, he should present himself like a dumb man.(10)"350. The meaning of the word "ascetic" in Oxford English-English-Hindi Dictionary (2008) on page64 is as under:"ascetic not allowing yourself physical pleasures, especially for religious reasons"351. In New Lexicon Webster's Dictionary of English Language, Deluxe Encyclopedic Edition, atpage 53, the word "ascetic" has been described as under:"as.cet.ic 1. adj. practicing self-discipline with a view to spiritual improvement, esp. by learning to dowithout things good in themselves (e.g. warmth, comfort) frugal, austere (of personal appearance)giving the impression of self-denial, gaunt, spare 2. n. a person who practices asceticism, a personwho lives an austere life."352. Learned counsel for plaintiff stated that the concept of 'Sanyas' is peculiar to Sanatan Dharmaand has its antiquity as back as origin of Dharma itself. The three principal divine powers which areworshiped in Sanatan Dharma i.e Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, look into Lord Mahesh as greatestSanyasi who lives in exile, observing a life almost alone from society.353. Importance of Sanyasis has been of so much significance that an entire Upnishad has beendevoted to it i.e. commonly known as 'Sanyasopnishad'. He briefly submitted that kinds of Sanyas,the life which a particular kind of Sanyasi is supposed to observe, and other commands which aSanyasi has to follow are contained in 'Sanyasopnishad. Certain verses thereof have been relied tosupport the point that a person claiming to become 'Shankaracharya' must be a 'Sanyasi', observingall kinds of commands mentioned in the aforesaid verses of 'Sanyasopnishad'.354. This Upnishad is related to the tradition of Samaveda. There are two chapters in it. Thecontents of first chapter are an introduction of reclusion procedure for obtaining a behaviour as alsopragmatic activities required for it. The second chapter is with prolix details. Its opening has beenmade with four means i.e. discretion, reluctance, six properties and desire for emancipation. Adetailed description on the criterion for reclusion has been given. While describing kinds of recluse,classification in (i) reluctant recluse (ii) knowledge recluse (iii) the recluse enriched with theknowledge and dettachment and the recluse who observes it in his activities, have been explained.Later on six types of reclusion i.e. Kutika, Bahudaka, Hamsa, Paramahamsa, Turiyatita andAvadhuta have been described in an orderly manner. The position of knowledge on soul or selfSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/142realization as also its nature has been described. The holiness in behaviour and a provision to satiatewith lesser food obtained on alms has been described.

The person giving up this mortal world through hisorderly manners is only the recluse. A question thus arises as to what is Sanyas? What is the natureof a recluse? Its answer is a person who for the upliftment of his soul abandons all the activitiesapproved by the parents, wife, the sons, brothers, etc., who performs the offering of Vaisvanarasubsequent to a salute to be conveyed to the ritvijs. It is advisable that the client at this auspiciousoccasion should donate everything and the Ritvij should be offered the material with the bodies inwhich it is kept. A recluse should impose in the five arirs-i.e. Prana, Apana, Vyana, Udana andSamana. The fire at the time of memory (Avasathya) and in Ahavantya, Garhapadya and Daksinagnifires, with the Vedic age fire. He should cut clear his all hair. He should further abandon thesacrificial thread and while observing his son he should say you are the offering and you are in theuniversal form. He should depart then towards East or North direction by addressing his own soul,when he has no son. He should accept alm from all the four Varnas i.e. Brahmanas, Kshatriyas,Vaishyas, and Shudras. He should take food after getting it in the bowl of his hands(handful). Thefood should be taken under presumption as if it is a medicine. In other words, it can be said that aman should take food only to extent that he may survive/preserve breathing. This food should alsobe entertained like a medicine free from fat and all impurities that develops excitement. Thus, withfeeble body, he should stay at night in a village and five nights in a city. During rainy season, heshould stay either in a village or city up to the period of two months counting by one fortnight equalto a month. He should live on rags or clothes made of bark of trees. No other kinds of garmentsshould be worn by him. Thus throwing oneself into penance to severe extent is the is Tap-Teetiksha.The person who accepts reclusion in this orderly manner, has answers to all questions relating toYagyopavit, Shikha, Achmana are thus: concentration towards soul is Yagyopavit, knowledge ofSupreme is his braid, his belly acts like a bowl to sip the water and his resort is bank of pool. Similarare the characteristics of the person who knows Brahma very well. What kind of Achmana is forthem at the time when Lord Sun departs to the west. Answer to this question is that the night andthe day both are equal to a recluse. He neither has a meaning for the night nor for day. He keepshimself indulged in the investigation of his soul and as per scholars, all night and days are like a dayfor such a recluse. (English translation by Court)(emphasis by Court)357.

Forbeing Brahmchari, Bhagwan Shanker has commented:One who knows that all is the Brahm, is called Brahman. (Shloka no. 52 Sadacharanusandhanam.)Bhagwan Adi Shankaracharya has clearly laid down that one who after attaining Sanyas iscontinuously practicing penance is a Sanyasi in true sense and not the one who just wraps himselfwith red cloth.

If holder of a Peeth(Peethadhyaksh) is pure, conqueror of senses, well versed in Vedas and Vedangas, knower of Yogand Shastras, he has authority to adorn the title of Adhyaksh (President) of Peetha. If he lacks allthese virtues, he is liable to be abandoned/restricted by scholars (Nigrahahon Manishinam)(Verse-11). According to an ancient note of Mahanushasan (which still remained unpublished) theword "Manishi" denotes -Grihasth disciple of Acharya. Ancient system was that Sanyasi Disciple ofShanker would become holder of Peetha (Seat) and its Grihasth disciple would become Deewan(Minister) thereof. Renuncitated Sanyasi remained engaged in spiritual uplift/pomotion of Peethabut worldly and practical affairs were assigned to this Grihasth Sanyasi. He discharged functions ofMinister. It was within his authority to remove an existing Peethadhyaksh from his Seat and causeto be seated another disciple on that seat in case, existing Peethadhyaksh Sanyasi was not capableenough to carry out the functions of Peeth. There was a very fine provision/system stipulated byAcharya. This system was famous and prevalent-Seat of Adhyaksh was in the hands of SanyasiDisciple and functions of Deewan were discharged by Grihasth disciple. In ancient times, this verysystem was suitably prevalent. By passage of deterioration, this system extinguished."(Page171)(English translation by Court)366.

These three classes are (a)Mourusi Math (b) Panchayati Math and (c) Hakimi Math which are detailed as under:(a) Mourusi Math: In a Mourusi Math the Guru-Shishya Parampara is followed and a Chelasucceeds to the office, which is usually nominated as successor by the reigning Guru (Head). SeniorChela by virtue of seniority does not automatically become entitled to the seat of Headship but it isthat Chela who stands nominated by the Head who becomes entitled for appointment and succeedto the office. This nomination can be done during the life time or by a written declaration or by somesort of testamentary documents. At the time of installation, he is granted recognition by theMembers of the particular sect and when funeral ceremony of the last Head is performed. It is worthquoting the following extract from B.K. Mukherjea (Hindu Law of Religious and Charitable Trust5th Edition). The following extract from Paragraph 7.41 is quoted herein below:"7.41 . . . In a hereditary Mutt the succession goes in the first place according to the test ofYajnavalkya to (lr~f'k";) or virtuous pupil. So, in order to entitle a person to succeed to the office of aMohant, it is not enough to show that he is a Chela or disciple of the latter. He must be a "lr~f'k";" ordisciple endowed with good qualities. The question arises as to how it is to be determined whether aChela fulfills this requirement or not? The way of determination must depend either upon theexpress directions of the founder of the endowment, if any, or upon the custom in each foundation.The custom in certain institutions may be that the senior most Chela is entitled to succeed as he ispresumed to be virtuous; or a "lr~f'k";" may be only that Chela who is nominated or appointed bySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/172the Guru during his lifetime, or accepted as such by the members of the fraternity after his death. Insuch cases also a Mutt may be called a Mourusi Mutt as the succession goes to the Chela and theappointment by the Guru or recognition by the other ascetics of the order might furnish theevidence of his being a virtuous disciple ...."(b) Panchayati Math: In a Panchayati Math the mode of appointment of a Mohunt is by election. Itdepends upon the custom of a particular institution as to who would be competent to exercise thepower of election. Generally Mohunt of the same sect (here to be understand as the 'Head') havingcommon origin assemble on the 13th day after the death of the last Mohunt and proceed to elect hissuccessor. Name given to the electoral body is Vhek or Punch, constitution of which is regulatedentirely by custom. Here also the tradition is that none but a disciple of last Mohunt could be electedby the Panch as a successor. Preference is given to Chelas of deceased but if they are not consideredto be qualified, the Panch can elect either a Guru Bhai of late Mohunt or somebody else connectedwith the institution or a Chela of another Mohunt belonging to the same sect.(c) Hakimi Math: In a case of Hakimi Math the appointment of Head is made by the ruling power(The Raja and Maharaja) or by the party who has endowed the Temple. However, after coming intoforce of Act No. 20 of 1863, the ruling powers in India divested itself of the right of nominating anyMohunt. However, the tradition of Hakimi Math continues where the families who originallyendowed the temple or the institutions is exercising the right as of custom to appoint the Head of aMath.367. Sri Goel further said and we find him right that since the time of establishment of Math, it hasfollowed Guru-Shishiya Parampara. Head of Maths have been appointed from time to time as perthe aforesaid tradition/Parampara. It has been followed by all Maths/Peethas, set up by AdiShankaracharya himself, who nominated four disciples at each Peeth set up by him, whereaftertradition of passing Headship from Guru to Chela has been constantly followed till date. There hasbeen nomination through testamentary instruments as well. All the ingredients relating to a"Mourusi Math" stands satisfied in the case of succession to Headship of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth.Essential character being that of a "Mourusi Math", the entire controversy is to be judged on theaforesaid genesis, otherwise it will result in deviation to the very basis of existence of Math. He alsoplaced reliance on V.K.Varadhachari's Law of Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, revisedby Dr. R. Prakash published by Easterm Book Company (Chapter 8 page 466 to 470).368. On the contrary, learned counsel for plaintiff argued that in case of aforesaid Four Monasteries(Maths) of Acharya Shanker, successor cannot be appointed by way of mere executing a will,because those monasteris are brother monasteries, established by a single person i.e. AcharyaShankar under single instrument i.e. 'Mathamnayasetu' or ' Mahanushasan' and in thesecommandments it has been clearly laid down that 1st set of four Shankaracharyas were appointed byAcharya Shankar himself. In this commandment Acharya Shankar has commanded that descendingsuccessors shall be appointed by consecrating him on concerned seat by the outgoingShankaracharya at the end of his rule (verse 52 of MM Eng. Edn) and said tradition is duly beingfollowed till date. Since all four Peethas have been established by a single person vide single GreatCommandment, verse 47 of Mathamanaya-Mahanushasan authorizes even a single ShankaracharyaSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/173to hold power of all four seats to avoid their extinction as also verse 49 of this Great Commandmentauthorizes Shankaracharya of other three monasteries to remove a person who has ascended on anyone of the aforesaid seats, without having prescribed qualification. Thus it is beyond doubt that inthat event, concerned monastery for all practical purpose shall be deemed to be in the joint custodyof other three Shankaracharyas for discharging their obligation to appoint new Shankaracharya outof the natural successors of deceased Shankaracharya. Otherwise, without Acharya, suchmonasteries shall be deemed to be extirpated which is strictly prohibited vide verse 50 supra. In thatevent it will be obligatory on the part of other three Shankaracharyas to select a worthy Renouncerhaving requisite qualification unanimously and consecrate him on the concerned seat.369. Our discussion justify us to hold that four Peethas established by Adi Shankaracharya cannotbe equated with ordinary Mutts, Ashrams or other religious endowments since they have a specialsignificance, reverence and followership in Sanatan Dharma. The commands of Mathamnay/Mahanushasan whether mandatory or recommendatory, or advisory, but the fact remains that theseare the instructions governing matters relating to selection of a person for installation in AmnayPeethas and mode and manner of further administration thereof and has got the status ofestablished custom and tradition having force of law. It is the own evidence of even appellant thatthese commands are to be observed in words and spirit strictly and, therefore, we have no manner ofdoubt to observe that these commands lay down eligibility and qualification of a person forinstallation of Shankaracharya and the manner in which four Amnay Peethas have to be regulatedand governed by those who are installed.370. For our purposes and for the purpose of present case even if we do not go into much details, yetthis is evident that for installing a person as Shankaracharya, the most important mandatoryconditions which must exist and the person selected and installed must possess, so as to becomesuitable, eligible and qualify to hold position of 'Shankaracharya' are:(i) He must be well versed in Vedas, Upnishads, Puranas and other scriptures etc.(ii) He must be a Dandi Sanyasi.(iii) He must be a Manishi.371. From the above discussion we have no manner of doubt that Adi Shankaracharya has a greatreverence among Sanatan Dharma followers/devotees who place him on the pedestal of incarnationof Lord Shiva. There are only four Peethas called 'Amanya Peeth' established by Adi Shankaracharyawhich have authority to have title and status of "Jagat Guru Shankaracharya" and the person whoholds that position and this title/office, got recognition from several centuries by customs andtraditions laid down in religious scriptures some sources of which are referred above, and followedby Sanatan Dharma devotees and followers, hence it cannot be allowed to be usurped by anyoneelse. Such an attempt would be nothing but an act of Imposter/ Trespasser and nothing but a fraudon religious denomination of Hindu Sanatan Dharma. We also find that the term ''Sanyas' as such isrecognized in Sanatan Dharma where a person who has completed formalities to become a 'Sanyasi'while in other religions and faiths a similar concept is given a different meaning, for example,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/174Bhikchuk (Monk) in Budhism, 'Muni' in Jainism, etc.372. Our observations are confined to the concept of "Jagat Guru Shankaracharya" who has a wellrecognized description, meaning, status and reverence in Sanatan Dharma and therefore, exceptprincipal authority installed at such Peethas established by Adi Shankaracharya i.e. (i) Jyotirmath,(ii) Shardamath, (iii) Sringeri Matha and (iv) Govardhan Matha, no other person can usurp or callhimself as "Jagat Guru Shankaracharya".373. Further, as we have seen that under commands of Adi Shankaracharya one 'Amanya Peetha'can have only one Head as Shankaracharya, two persons claiming themselves as 'Shankaracharya' ofsame Peeth is also patently illegal, unauthorized and nothing but an attempt of usurpation of thatstatus. In fact this act or attempt on the part of a person who claimed to stand parallel'Shankaracharya' of a Peeth itself would render him ineligible to be called or treated asShankaracharya.374. The two books of commands, Vedas, Upnishads and other relevant religious scriptures, some ofwhich we have already referred to, make it very clear that in the four Amanya Peeths of AdiShankaracharya, Guru-Shishya Parampara has been followed since very beginning after initialinstallation by Adi Shankaracharya. The commands also contemplate a situation where a sittingShankaracharya could not nominate his successor, or nominated or installed successor is notsuitable and eligible. In such circumstances Manishigan, i.e., people of great learning which mayinclude Shankaracharyas of other Peethas will have authority to select and install an appropriatesuitable person as Shankaracharya of such Peeth or to remove and appoint another one. But thiscondition will be attracted only when successor is not nominated by outgoing Shankaracharya Theseconstitute well established customary law and therefore have to be followed strictly.375. There may be a situation when a person nominated by outgoing Shankaracharya or installed byearlier functioning Shankaracharya is found unsuitable or suffers subsequently somedisqualification i.e. conditions prescribed in aforesaid books laying down customs and usage and insuch circumstances after taking a conscious decision, and due notice to concerned person aboutalleged unsuitability or disqualification, he suffers or has attained, and after a proper removalthereof, a new person can be selected and installed as Shankaracharya by Manishigans as definedand explained in earlier discussion.376. Looking to Verses-47 and 50 of "Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan", we are also of the viewthat in an emergency or other grave condition, a situation may arise where one Shankaracharya maybe required to look after more than one Peeth. But that situation being of emergency and for certainunforeseen circumstances, would mean that it is a temporary arrangement and has to stop as soonas possible. Such a situation cannot continue for years together as that will amount to a completeviolation of the well established customary laws in this regard laid down in the aforesaid commandsand other scriptures. Such a situation has to be rectified at the earliest. But in no case, one Peeth canhave two Shankaracharyas and a person who does not fulfill requisite qualification also cannot beappointed thereat.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/175377. Three points for determination, formulated above, therefore, are answered as under:Answer (First Point):Adi Shankaracharya and four Amnaya Peeths established by him have a special but great reverenceand significance in the entire religious denomination of this Country following Sanatan Dharma andShankar Philosophy and we can take judicial notice of this fact that this denomination constitutesmajority people of this Country.Answers (Second and Third Points):"Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan" are commands of regulations of eligibility and suitability ofperson to be installed as Shankaracharya, the manner in which one can be appointed or removedand also containing conditions for regulation of these Peethas.We also simultaneously hold that for installation of Shankaracharya, the essential eligibilityconditions includes that one must be a Sanyasi, well conversant in Sanskrit, well versed in religiousscriptures like Vedas, Upnishads, Brahmans etc., must be disciple of an Acharya of Amnaya Peeth inwhich he is to be selected and installed, and, should also follow all regulations and instructionswhich are provided in various scriptures like "Mathamnaya", "Mahanushasan" and Upnishads etc.,some of which we have already discussed above.378. The fourth point for determination would be, "whether at Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, installationof Shankaracharya has always followed Guru-Shishya Parampara or there has been an exception forinstallation of Shankaracharya thereat?"379. It is the admitted case of both the parties that Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth is the fourth Peethestablished by Adi Shankaracharya. In this regard, some history has been traced by Pt. HarikrishnaRaturi in "Garhwal ka Itihas" (supra) which has been placed before us and since this historicalscriptures has not been disputed by both the parties, therefore we may refer extract thereof asunder.380.

It is not disputed before us also that last known Shankaracharya, who held this seat atJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth was Swami Ram Krishna, who died in 1833 Vikram Samvat (1776 A.D.)and thereafter for about 165 years, Peeth remained defunct.

Yes, in the official files of Garhwal Government, 5 Biswas of land has been continuingin the name of Math."386. It is common case of both the parties that B.D.M., VNS, other Shankaracharyas of threePeethas and other learned Brahmans and Pandits selected Swami Sri Brahmanand Saraswati as asuitable person to be installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth; a declaration oftrust-deed was prepared on 11.05.1941 and Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was installed on11.05.1941 as Shankaracharya by the said congregation of Manishigans. Thus since Vikram Swavat1833 to 1998 (1776 to 1941 AD), Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth did not have any Shankaracharya and thenew one, who was installed in 1941, did not come into office by virtue of Guru-Shishya Parampara.He was installed by Manishigans as contemplated in "Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan" which wehave discussed above. This is admitted case of both the parties. In plaint, the plaintiff has averredthese facts in para 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 of plaint, which read as under:"8.

We, therefore, answer this fourth point for determination as under:Answer (Fourth Point):In the past, Guru-Shishya Parampara was followed in Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth but due tounavoidable circumstances, it had broken sometimes in 1833 Vikram Swavat (1776 AD) and after165 years, installation of Shankaracharya was made by selection of a suitable person by Manishigansand not following Guru-Shishya Parampara pursuant whereto Swami Brahmanand Saraswati cameto be installed and functioned as such for about 12 years.388. Fifth point for determination is "who came to be installed as Shankaracharya after death ofSwami Brahmanand Saraswati in 1953?"Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/180389. In para-19 of plaint, it is said by plaintiff that after death of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati itwas found that a ''Will' was executed by him on 18.12.1952 nominating four persons as his successor,namely, (a) Ramji Triapthi (subsequently known as Shanta Nand Saraswati) (b) Dwarika PrasadShastri (subsequently known as Dwarikeshanand Saraswati (c) Swami Vishnu Deva Nand Saraswatiand (d) Swami Parmanand Saraswati. Plaintiff's case is that learned Brahmans and otherShankaracharyas considered Ramji Tripathi and found him ineligible having no knowledge ofSanskrit and, therefore, his claim for installation as Shankaracharya was rejected by learnedPandits, Sanyasis and other Shankaracharyas, though Ramji Tripathi, i.e. Shanta Nand Saraswatistarted to claim himself as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth.390. In the written statement, case set up by appellant is that after death of Swami BrahmanandSaraswati, his ''Will' was opened and as per nomination made, Ramji Tripathi (Swami Shanta NandSaraswati) was installed as his successor. The question of selection by Manishigans did not arise,following Guru-Shishya Parampara, Swami Brahmanand Saraswati had already nominated SwamiShanta Nand Saraswati as his successor.391. This issue was raised at the earliest by four persons, namely, Swami Parmatmanand Saraswati,Nagesh Upadhyay, Mahadev Shastri and Sudarshan Lal Bajpai in Original Suit No. 3 of 1954 filed inrepresentative capacity under Section 92 CPC impleading Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati as soledefendant. They sought relief for removal of Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati from the office ofShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and also a declaration for Swami Krishna Bodhashramas duly installed Shankaracharya of the said Peeth. As we have already given history of suit in earlierpart which ultimately resulted in a final verdict by Supreme Court in Swami ParmatmanandSaraswati and another Vs. Ramji Tripathi (supra), from the pleadings therein, we find that it wasadmitted case of plaintiffs therein that there existed a ''will' dated 07.12.1952 which was publishedon 08.06.1952, after death of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati on 20.05.1953. As per nominationmade in the said ''will' first choice was Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati, who accepted office andinstalled as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 12.06.1953. Supreme Court judgmentshows that a section of worshippers installed Swami Krishna Bodhashram as Shankaracharya ofMath on 25.06.1953, since according to them, Brahmanand did not execute any will nominating hissuccessor, and in any case 'will' was not executed by him while he was in a sound disposing state ofmind. Supreme Court, in para 4 of judgment also said that Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati wasinstalled on 12.06.1953 and came in possession of Mutt properties. The aforesaid suit failed for thereason that Court found that suit was filed for the benefit of an individual and not on the ground ofmismanagement or breach of condition of management of a trust etc. The aforesaid suit, as alreadysaid, was filed under Section 92. Court held that a suit under Section 92 is a suit of special naturewhich pre-supposes existence of public trust of a religious or charitable character and such suit canproceed only on the allegations that there was a breach of trust or that the direction of Court isnecessary for administration of trust and plaintiffs must pray for one or more of the reliefs that arementioned in Section 92. Court also held that suit basically was filed for declaration that SwamiKrishna Bodhashram was duly installed as Shankaracharya of Mutt on 25.06.1953 and SwamiShanta Nand Saraswati had no right to be nominated as head of Mutt since he did not possessrequisite qualification and his possession of the trust property was only in the capacity of a trusteede son tort, and so he must be removed from the headship of Math. Supreme Court upheld dismissalSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/181of suit being not maintainable under Section 92 CPC. Relevant finding contained in para 12 ofjudgment read as under:"The trial Court, after reading the allegations in the plaint and afterlooking into the entire evidencein the case, came to the conclusion that the suit was primarily one for declaration thatKrishnabodhashram was duly installed as the Shankaracharya of the Math on June 25, 1953 andthat respondent No. 1 had no right to be nominated as the Head of the Math by Brahmanand as hedid not possess the requisite qualification and that his possession of the trust property was only inthe capacity, of a trustee de son tort, and so he must be removed from the headship of the Math. TheHigh Court saw no reason to differ from that finding. We would be slow to disturb a finding of thisnature especially when we see that the allegations in the plaint are reasonably susceptible of beingso read. We think that the purpose of the suit was to settle the controversy as to whetherKrishnabodhashram or respondent No. 1 had the better claim to the headship of the Math and to thepossession and management of its properties by obtaining a declaration of the Court. If the realpurpose in bringing the Suit was to vindicate the general right of the public to have the rightfulclaimant appointed to the office,, there was no reason why the plaintiffs omitted to implead or atleast refer in the plaint to the three persons nominated by Brahmanand in his will to succeed him inthe order indicated therein especially when it is seen that the plaintiffs accepted the custom of theMath to have the successor nominated by the incumbent for the time, being of the office ofShankaracharya."392. The aforesaid judgment is relevant to the fact that for the benefit of Swami KrishnaBodhashram a suit was filed for removal of Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati from the office ofShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and therein it was an admitted case that Swami ShantaNand Saraswati was installed on 12.06.1953 and took possession of property of Mutt.393. In para 20 of plaint in present case, plaintiff admits that Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati startedto claim headship of Jyotirmath. Several plaintiff's witnesses have also deposed that Swami ShantaNand Saraswati was removed from the Office of Shankaracharya. When one says that a person wasremoved, it pre-supposes an admission that such person was appointed/installed in the seat.Relevant depositions of PW-1 and PW-31 read as under:PW-1 Sri Shyam Sundar Vajpai (X):^^d`".k cks/kJe dk vf/k"Bkiu djds jke th f=ikBh mQZ Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn ljLorh ds vf/k"Bkiu dkfuxzg fd;k x;k FkkA T;ksfr"ihB ds fu;e ijEijk o jhfr ds vuqlkj jke th f=ikBh mQZ 'kkUrkuUn ljLorhdks T;ksfr"ihB ds ihBk/kh'oj in ls inP;qr dj fn;k x;kA^^Â¼isij ua0&455 d] ist&2786&2787Â½ "Byanointing KrishnaBodhShram as Shankaracharya of Jyotish Peeth, the investiture of Ram JiTripathi alias Swami Shantanand Saraswati was rendered nugatory.

(English Translation by Court) Answer (Fifth Point):396. We, therefore, find no difficulty in holding that on 12.06.1953 after death of SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati, following nomination made by him vide ''Will' dated 18.12.1952, his firstchoice, namely, Ramji Tripathi, i.e., Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati was installed as Shankaracharyaof Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 12.06.1953 and we answer the aforesaid point for determinationaccordingly.397. The next points for determination which can be considered together are:(6) Whether Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati was removed (Nigrah) from office of Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth?(7) Whether Swami Krishna Bodhashram was installed as Shankaracharya on 25.06.1953 validly,i.e., if there was no person holding the said office so as to give an opportunity of makingappointment/installation in the said office on 25.06.1953?(8) Whether this issue having already been decided by Court in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965, wouldoperate as res judicata and related issues in suit in question would be barred by the said principle inview of decision in Suit No. 36 of 1965?398. In the alternative, Ninth Point for determination would be "whether judgment dated 15.01.1970passed by Trial Court in Suit No. 36 of 1965 can be said to have attained finality after dismissal offirst appeal having abated due to death of sole defendant-appellant and non substitution of his legalrepresentatives and if so, this question cannot be considered in any subsequent proceeding.

In the present case, Trial Court has examined the question of functioning of Swami KrishnaBodhashram from 25.06.1953 to 10.09.1973 and whether suit is barred by principle of res judicataor not, i.e., Issues- 9 and 16.

These issues were neither under consideration in Suit no. 36/1965 norhave been decided. The issue which is involved in this suit was not under consideration in earlierSuit no. 36/1965. As far as the statement of the defendant is concerned that the plaintiff has beenappointed by Swami Krishanbodhashram, from paras 29, 30 and 31 of the plaint of the plaintiff, it isclear that the plaintiff was looking after the affairs of the Peetha during the illness of SwamiKrishanbodhashram and his name was also proposed by Swami Krishanbodhashram but after thedeath of Swami Krishanbodhashram on 10.09.1973, the question of appointment of Shankaracharyaof Jyotishpeetha again arose; and Shankaracharyas of other three Peethas, Sanyasis, Grihasthas,devotees, Bharat Dharam Mahamandal, Kashi Vidwat Parishad and others performed plaintiff'sinstallation and Abhishek as Shankaracharya on 07.12.1973. It was never claimed by the plaintiffthat his appointment and installation was done by Swami Krishanbodhashram nor has he said thathe was appointed as a successor by Swami Krishanbodhashram. From this, it is evident that plaintiffhas not claimed himself to be appointed through Swami Krishana bodhashram rather in themanner, Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was installed by Shankaracharyas of other three Peethas,Kashi Vidwat Parishad and Peetha's followers and his Pattabhishek was performed by them,likewise he was also appointed following the rules of Mathamanay and Mahanushasan and traditionof the Peetha. It has been stated by the plaintiff in para 28 and 29 of his testimony on affidavit beingpaper no. 423Ka that after death of Swami Krishanbodhashram on 10.09.1973, the Peetha again fellvacated because Swami Krishanbodhashram had not appointed anybody on his Peetha. Similarly, ithas also been stated by the plaintiff's witness PW-1 in paras 17 and 18 of his testimony on affidavitbeing paper no. 425Ka/4 that no successor was appointed by Swami Krishanbodhashram and theinstallation of plaintiff was performed on 07.12.1973 by the aforesaid scholars on account of thePeetha having fallen vacant. Plaintiff's witness PW 4 has in para 7 of his statement on oath beingpaper no 426 ka stated regarding non-nomination by Swami Krishnabodhashram and PW 5 has inpara 8 of his statement on oath, paper no 427 ka, stated that since Swami Krishnabodhashram hasnominated none as his successor, the aforesaid learned persons nominated the plaintiff asJyotispeethadheeshwar. It makes clear that Swami Krishnabodhashram having died on 10.09.1973,no person had been appointed by him in his life time. For this very reason, until the plaintiff wasanointed , the Peeth remained vacant from 10.09.1973 to 07.12.1973, without Shankaracharya.okn la[;k 36@1965 ds fu.kZ; fnukad 15-01-1970 ds fo:) Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe o vU; }kjk vihy dh x;hFkh vkSj nkSjku vihy gh fnukad 10-09-1981 dks Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dh e`R;q gks x;h Fkh vkSj vihyvcsV gks x;hA tSlk fd izfroknh }kjk izLrqr izi= 302x ds i`"B 11 ij ,usDlpj&8 esa Li"V fd;k x;k gSAysfdu bl okn esa izfroknh dh vksj ls mDr vihy dh dksbZ lR;kfir izfrfyfi nkf[ky ugha dh x;h gSASwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/186mijksDr ds voyksdu ls Li"V gS fd okn la[;k 36@1965 dk okn Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn }kjk Lokehd`".kcks/kkJe o nks vU; ds fo:) lk/kkj.k fu"ks/kkKk dh okn ;ksftr fd;k Fkk ftlesa ;g vuqrks"k ekaxkx;k Fkk fd izfroknhx.k Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dks 'kadjkpk;Z mn~?kksf"kr u djsa rFkk Lokehd`".kcks/kkJe dks 'kadjkpk;Z mn~?kksf"kr djus ls fu"ksf/kr djus gsrq ;ksftr fd;k x;k FkkA mDrfu.kZ; O;fDry{;h fu.kZ; gksxk yksdy{;h ugha gksxkA ysfdu vihy ds fu.kZ; ls iwoZ gh fnukad10-09-1973 dks Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dh e`R;q gks x;hA vr% muds fo:) okn izFke n`"V;k gh(infructuous) fu"Qy gks x;kA D;ksafd ftldks fuf"k) djus gsrq vuqrks"k ekWaxk x;k Fkk og gh nkSjkuvihy gh fcuk vihy ds xq.knks"k ds vk/kkj ij fuLrkfjr gq;s e`R;q gks x;hA vr% mDr okn esa Lokehd`".kcks/kkJe ds f[kykQ okn dk dkj.k gh lekIr gks x;k ,oe~ mDr okn ds lkjs i{kdkj czg~eyhu gks x;sgSa vr% fu.kZ; O;FkZ ,oe~ izHkkoghu gks x;kA D;ksafd okn la[;k 36@1965 nksuksa i{kksa dsO;fDrxr vf/kdkjksa ds lEcU/k esa Fkk vkSj O;fDrxr vf/kdkj e`R;q ds lkFk gh lekIr gks tkrs gSaA blokn esa oknh ds vf/kdkj vkSj ;ksX;rkvksa dks ns[kk tkuk gSA /kkjk 11 flfoy izfdz;k lafgrk dk izko/kkuLi"V djrk gS fd iwoZ okn dh fo"k; oLrq o ik'pkrorhZ okn dh fo"k; oLrq leku gks] leku fo"k;oLrq dkfu.kZ; lkjHkwr :i ls fd;k x;k gks iwoZ ds okn o ik'pkrorhZ okn ds i{kdkj leku gksa vFkok i{kdkj viusiwoZ oknh ;k izfroknh ds ek/;e ls LoRo dk nkok dj jgs gksa] fu.kZ; l{ke U;k;ky; }kjk fd;k x;k gks vkSjfu.kZ; vfUre :i ls gqvk gksA tks Hkh O;fDr 'kadjkpk;Z ds :i ea xn~nh (office) dk nkok djrk gS mlh dhO;fDrxr ;ksX;rkvksa vkSj v;ksX;rkvksa dk ijh{k.k fd;k tk ldrk gSA izLrqr okn esa tks okn fcUnq cuk;sx;s gSa og oknh o izfroknh ds T;ksfr"ihB ds 'kadjkpk;Z ds :i esa vko';d ;ksX;rkvksa ds /kkjd gSavFkok ugha gS rFkk dkSu oS/k :i ls vf/k"Bkfir 'kadjkpk;Z gSa] dk fuLrkj.k fd;k tkuk gSA fuf'pr :i ls ;grF; okn la[;k 36@1965 esa ugha FkkA i{kdkj Hkh leku ugha Fks] izfroknh Hkys gh vius vf/kdkjksadks iwoZ i{kdkj ds ek/;e ls nkok dj jgk gksA ysfdu oknh iwoZ i{kdkj ds ek/;e ls vius vf/kdkjksa dknkok ugha dj jgk gS vkSj u gh Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe }kjk mUgsa crkSj 'kadjkpk;Z fu;qDr fd;k x;k gSAD;ksafd mudh fu;qfDr rhuksa 'kadjkpk;ksZa rFkk Hkkjr /keZ egke.My] fo}r ifj"kn o vU; }kjk Lora=:i ls dh x;h gS vr% og mUgha ds ek/;e ls t;ksfr"ihB ds 'kadjkpk;Z ds :i esa vius vf/kdkjksa dk nkok djjgs gSaA okn la[;k 36@1965 dk fu.kZ; fnukad 17-01-1970 dks fu.khZr fd;k x;k ftlds fo:) Lokehd`".kcks/kkJe }kjk vihy dh x;hA dkxt la[;k 876x ds voyksdu ls Li"V gS fd Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn }kjkLokeh d`".kcks/kkJe ds LFkku ij oknh Lo:ikuan dks i{kdkj cukrs gq;s o"kZ 1977 esa fu"iknu okn22@1977 ;ksftr fd;k gS tks fnukad 06-04-1985 dks [kkfjt gks x;k ftldk izi= dkxt la[;k 882x@2 oknhdh vksj ls izLrqr fd;k x;k gSA vr% mDr okn dh fu"iknu dk;Zokgh Hkh oknh ds fo:) lQy ugha gq;hvkSj u gh vkt rd mDr okn ds vk/kkj ij mUgsa jksdk x;k gSA blls Hkh Li"V gS fd oknh Lokehd`".kcks/kkJe ds ek/;e ls viuk nkok ugh izLrqr fd;k gSA vihy nkf[ky gksus dk Li"V eryc gS fd vHkhokn dh iqu% lquok;h gksxhA blh dkj.k vihy okn tkjh (Continuation of suit) gksuk gksrk gS vFkkZr~okn dk foLrkj jgrk gS rFkk vihy esa tks vkns'k gksrk gS mlesa v/khuLFk U;k;ky; dk fu.kZ; lekfgrÂ¼MergedÂ½ gks tkrk gSA tSlk fd xksiky yky cuke Jherh vUukckbZ o vU; ,-vkbZ-vkj- 1998 jktLFkkuist 300 esa dgk x;k gSA blds vfrfjDr fnukad 28-02-1980 dks R;kxi= nsus ds ckn Lokeh 'kkUrkuUnljLorh dks crkSj 'kadjkpk;Z eqdnek yM+us dk Hkh dksbZ vf/kdkj ugha jg x;k Fkk vkSj u gh Lokehfo".kwnsokuUn vihy o"kZ 1981 esa vcsV gksus rd mlds i{kdkj cusA An appeal was filed against theorder dated 15.01.1970 passed in Suit no 36/1965 by Swami Krishnabodhashram and others, andduring the pendency of the appeal Swami Krishnabodhashram died on 10.09.1981 with the resultthe appeal abated, as clarified in annexure 8 of page 11 of paper 302C filed on behalf of thedefendant. But in this case, no certified copy of the aforesaid appeal has been filed on behalf ofdefendant. It is clear from perusal of the aforesaid that an injunction suit no 36/1965 was filed bySwami Shantanand against Swami Krishnabodhashram and two others, seeking the relief ofinjunction that defendants should not declare Swami Krishnabodhashram as Shankaracharya andSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/187also for restraining the defendants not to declare Swami Krishnabodhashram as Shankaracharya.The aforesaid decision would be personified, not in the public interest. But prior to the decision ofappeal, Swami Krishnabodhashram died on 10.09.1973. Hence, the case against him prima-facierendered infructuous because the person against whom relief of injunction was sought, had diedprior to the disposal of the suit on merits. Hence, in the aforesaid case, cause of action itself endedand all parties to the suit have died; hence, the decision has become non est. Suit no 36/1965 was inrespect of rights of both the parties and individual rights come to an end with the happening ofdeath. In this case, plaintiff's rights and qualifications have to be examined. Provision of Section 11C.P.C. clearly provides that if the facts of the earlier case and the latter one are similar, the similarissues have substantially been decided, the parties of earlier and latter case are same and the partiesare claiming title through the plaintiff or defendant, decision is rendered finally by the competentCourt. Qualifications and disqualifications can be examined only of the person staking claim for theoffice of Shankaracharya. Issue framed in this case, as to whether or not the plaintiff and thedefendant possess essential qualifications for installation as Shankaracharya of Jyotispeeth and asto who is the legally anointed Shankaracharya, has to be decided. Certainly, this fact was not there inCase no 36/1965. Parties were also not same. Though, the defendant may be claiming his rightsthrough earlier party (the parties of the earlier case). But the plaintiff is not claiming his rightsthrough earlier party nor has he been appointed as Shankaracharya by Swami Krishnabodhashram,because his appointment was made independently by other three Shankaracharyas, Bharat DharmMahamandal, Vidwat Parishad and others. Hence, he is claiming his right as Shankaracharya of theJyotispeeth through them. Suit no 36/1965 was decided on 17.01.1970 against which an appeal waspreferred by Swami Krishnabodhashram. It is clear from a perusal of paper no 876 Ga thatExecution Case no 22/1977 has been instituted by Swami Shantanand in the year 1977, bysubstituting Swami Krishnabodhashram with plaintiff Swaroopanand, which was dismissed on06.04.1985, paper in respect whereof has been filed as Paper No. 882 Ga/2 on behalf of the plaintiff.Hence, the execution in the aforesaid suit against the plaintiff did not succeed nor has he ever beenrestrained on the ground of the said case. It also makes it clear that the plaintiff has not filed the suitthrough Swami Krishnabodhashram. Filing of appeal clearly indicates that the case is still to beheard. For this very reason, it amounts to continuation of suit, i.e. the case gets extended and orderof the subordinate Court, is merged in the order passed in passed in appeal as laid down at Page 300of the case of Gopal Lal versus Smt Anna Bai and others A.I.R. 1998. Besides it, Swami ShantanandSaraswati after tendering his resignation on 28.02.1980 was left with no right to contest a litigationin the capacity of the Shankaracharya nor did Swami Vishnudevanand become its party until 1981,the year when the appeal stood abated.fof/k O;oLFkk equh'k dqekj vfXugks=h o vU; cuke yYyh izlkn xqIrk ,vkbZvkj 1989 bykgkckn 202 esaHkh ekuuh; mPp U;k;ky; }kjk Li"V fd;k x;k gS fd ;fn i{kdkj iwoZ orhZ okn esa i{kdkj ugha gS vkSj ugh iwoZorhZ okn ds i{kdkjksa ds ek/;e ls viuk nkok dj jgk gS rks izkax U;k; dk fl)kUr ykxw ughagksxkA fof/k O;oLFkk LVsV vkQ egkjk"V~ cuke us'kuy dkULV~d'ku dEiuh ckEcs ,vkbZvkj 1996lqizhedksVZ 2367 esa ekuuh; loksZPp U;k;ky; }kjk ;g izfrikfnr fd;k x;k gS fd okn ;k vihy ;fn rduhfddkj.kksa ls [kkfjt gksrs gSa rks og dksbZ fu.kZ; ugha gSA 3 ,lh,l gSnjkckn cuke E;wfufliy dkjiksjs'kugSnjkckn ,vkbZvkj 1995 vkU/kz izns'k 17] Mk;jsDVj lsUV~y eSjhu f'kjht fjlpZ bULVhV~;wV cuke ,dukdu o vU; 2009 Â¼17Â½ lqizhe dksVZ dslst ist 253] ,u Jh dkUrk, mQZ ,e0,u0 Jh dkUrk, cuke,e0,u0 efYydktqZukgs ,vkbZvkj 1996 dukZVd 193] vYdk xqIrk cuke ujsUnz dqekj xqIrk ,vkbZvkjSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/1882011 lqizhe dksVZ ist 9 vkfn fof/kd uthjksa esa Hkh izfrikfnr fd;k x;k gS fd okn dk dkj.k fHkUu gksusrFkk u;k okn dkj.k gksus ij izkax U;k; dk fl)kUr ykxw ugha gksrk gSA It has also made clear by theHon'ble High Court in the authority laid down in Muneesh Kumar Agnihotri and others versus LalliPrasad Gupta AIR 1989 Allahabad 202 that if the parties are not parties to earlier case nor are theyclaiming through the parties of the earlier case, in such a situation, principle of res judicata shall notapply.

The cause of action in latter case is a fresh cause ofaction. This is a case of simple injunction. Parties of both the cases are different, facts of both casesare different and issues related to qualifications of different persons and issues for determination ofeligibility and installation of different persons in the two suits are differently involved and the issuesthat are framed, too are different. Hence the authorities, cited on behalf of defendant, i.e.Pondicherry Khadi and Village Industries Board versus P.

Trial Court, we find, has proceeded in a very strange manner. It has not held 'Will' dated18.12.1952 ingenuine or having not been executed by Testator, i.e., Swami Brahmanand Saraswati.On the contrary, findings recorded in respect of 'Will' in earlier litigation has been left untouched.The result would be that for the purpose of present suit, 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 has to be treated, avalid 'Will' having all legal consequences. Court below has also observed that in the present case itcannot be examined, whether Swami Shantanand had knowledge of Sanskrit or not. That being so, itwas not open to Trial Court to proceed further to assume or presume or to treat something alreadysettled regarding knowledge of Sanskrit of Swami Shantanand so as to proceed with the assumptionthat Swami Shantanand was not qualified to hold the seat of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and, therefore, seat must be deemed to be vacant. This is a contradictory findingrecorded by Trial Court. Once it has held that it cannot examine, whether Swami ShantanandSaraswati possessed knowledge of Sanskrit or not, it had no authority to proceed further on thisaspect. Unfortunately we find that in order to bring in and make installation of Swami KrishnaBodhashram valid, there was no other way and hence Trial Court despite observing that it cannotexamine the question, whether Swami Shantanand possessed knowledge of Sanskrit or not, stillproceeded to hold that he did not have such knowledge and, therefore, was removed from the seat ofShankaracharya by congregation of Manishigans. Aforesaid finding has been recorded by TrialCourt at internal pages 151 to 153 (Page 275 to 277 Vol-I, Appellant's Paper Book) and we mayreproduce the above contradictory and illegal finding recorded by Trial Court as under:^^Lokeh czg~ekuUn dh e`R;q fnukad 20-05-53 ds dkQh fnukas rd ;g Hkh irk ugh Fkk fd dkSuO;fDr 'akdjkpk;Z gksxkA lEHkor% blfy;s vUrfje desVh dk xBu fd;k x;k ftlds v/;{k orZeku okn dsoknh FksA tc bykgkckn ls ykdj olh;r [kksyh x;h rks Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn dk uke izFke dze esa izdk'k esavk;kA okn la[;k 3@54 o 36@65 ds voyksdu ls Li"V gS fd mUgsa laLd`r dk Kku ugh FkkA okn la[;k36@65 ds voyksdu ls Hkh mUgsa laLd`r dk Kku Fkk bl lEcU/k esa dksbZ fu"d"kZ ugh gSA Hkys ghoknh ds xokg ih0MCyw0&4] ih0MCyw0&5 o ih0MCyw0&33 us Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn dks laLd`r dkKku u gksus ds lEcU/k esa xokgh nh gS rFkk izfroknh ds xokg Mh0MCyw0&3 Lokeh oklqnsokuUnljLorh }kjk vius l'kiFk lk{; ds ist 41 ij Mh0MCyw0&4 Jh jaxukFk nqcs }kjk vius l'kiFk lk{; ds ist 5 ij]Mh0MCyw0&32 Lokeh ;ksX;'ojkuUn fxjh }kjk vius l'kiFk lk{; ds ist 13 ij] Mh0MCyw0&38 LokehegUr euksgj iqjh }kjk vius l'kiFk lk{; ds ist 7 ij] Mh0MCyw0&22 Jh bUnw izdk'k mik/;k; us viusl'kiFk lk{; ds ist 10 ij 'kadjkpk;Z ds fy;s laLd`r dk Kku gksuk vko';d crk;k gSA ysfdu U;k;ky; dks bl Lrjij ;g fu.khZr ugh djuk gS fd Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn dks laLd`r dk Kku gS ;k ughA ysfdu okn la[;k 3@54 ookn la[;k 36@65 ls vo/kkj.kk yh tk ldrh gS fd mUgsa laLd`r dk Kku ugh FkkA ;gh dkj.k gS fdfo}kuksa euh"khx.k us eBkEuk; egkuq'kklue~ ds izko/kkuksa ds v/khu mudk fuxzg dj Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dks 'kadjkpk;Z ds in ij vklhu djk;kA vU;Fkk vkSj dksbZ dkj.k Lokeh d`".k cks/kkJe dksvf/k"Bkfir djus dk ugh FkkA okn la[;k 3@54 o okn la[;k 36@65 esa Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dkvf/k"Bkiu fnukad 25-06-53 dks ekuk x;k gSA okn la[;k 36@65 esa Hkh vf/k"Bkiu fnukad 25-06-53dks rks ekuk x;k ysfdu 'kadjkpk;Z dk in fjDr u gksus ds dkj.k mls oS/k ugh ekuk x;kA mDr vkns'k dhvihy ;ksftr gq;h D;ksafd fof/k vuqlkj vihy okn dk tkjh Â¼Appeal is the continuation of suitÂ½ jgukgksrk gS rFkk vihy dk vf/kdkj dkuwuh vf/kdkj gS ftlesa okn dh iqu% lquok;h dh tkrh gS ftlesaSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/191v/khuLFk U;k;ky; ds vkns'k dks [kkfjt Hkh fd;k tk ldrk gS rFkk mldh iqf"V Hkh gks ldrh gS rFkk mlsiqu% lquok;h gsrq v/khuLFk U;k;ky; ds ikl Hkstk Hkh tk ldrk gSA v/khuLFk U;k;ky; dk vkns'k vihyds nkSjku gh vfUre ugh gks tkrk gS cfYd vihy dk fuLrkj.k xq.k nks"k ds vk/kkj ij gkus dh fLFkr esav/khuLFk U;k;ky; dk vkns'k vihy esa lekfgr gks tkrk gS vkSj vihy esa ikfjr vkns'k vfUre gksrk gSA oknla[;k 3@54 esa Hkh ikfjr vkns'k dh vihy ekuuh; mPp U;k;ky; esa 385@62 ;ksftr dh x;h tks 11-09-73dks fu.khZr gq;hA tc fd Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dh e`R;q fnukad 10-09-73 dks gh gks pqdh FkhA bllsHkh Li"V gksrk gS fd mDr vihy Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dh e`R;q rd yfEcr Fkh vkSj dksbZ Hkh vkns'kczg~eyhu gksus ds fnukad rd vfUre ugh FkkA okn la[;k 36@65 dk fu.kZ; 01-09-70 esa ikfjr fd;k x;kftldh vihy ;ksftr dh x;hA fof/k vuqlkj vihy okn dk tkjh Â¼Appeal is the continuation of suitÂ½ jgukgksrk gSA mDRk vihy 29-08-81 rd yfEcr jgh tks izfroknh ds izi= 302 ds vuqlkj Lokeh d`".k cks/kkJeds czg~eyhu gksus ds dkj.k vcsV gq;hA blls Li"V gksrk gS fd tc rd Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe thfor jgs mDrvihy dk fujLrkj.k ugh gqvk Fkk vkSj og yfEcr FkhA "Many days after demise of Swami Brahmannandon 20.05.1953, it was not known as to who would be Shankaracharya. Hence, probably, it was thereason that an Interim Committee was constituted, President whereof was the present plaintiff ofthe suit. When the will was opened on being brought from Allahabad, the name of SwamiShantanand came into light figuring at the top of the list. From perusal of suits no. 3/54 and 36/65,it is clear that he had no knowledge of Sanskrit language. On perusal of suit no. 36/65 also, noconclusion can be drawn with respect to his knowledge of Sanskrit. Although, the witnesses of theplaintiff, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-33 have deposed about lack of knowledgable of Sanskrit language ofSwami Shantanand, and the witnesses of defendant, DW-3 Swami Vasudevanand Sarswati in hisoral testimony, at page number 41, DW-4 Shri Rangnath Dubey in his oral testimony at pagenumber 5, DW-32 Swami Yogeshwaranand in his statement on oath at page number 13, DW-38Swami Mahant Manohar Puri in his statement on oath at page number 7, DW-22 Shri Indu PrakashJaiswal in his evidence on oath at page number 10, have stated that knowledge of Sanskrit is a mustfor Shankaracharya. But the Court is not to decide at this stage as to whether Swami ShantananadSarswati had the knowledge of Sanskrit or not; but from Suits no. 3/54 and 36/65, one can drawinference that he had no knowledge of Sanskrit language. It was the reason why the learned seerswhile doing his Nigrah (restraint) as ordained by 'Mathamanay Mahanushasan', had made to installKrishnabodhashram to hold the office of Shankaracharya. Otherwise, there was no reason to installSwami Krishnabodhashram. In suits no. 3/54 and 36/65, the date of enthronement ofKrishnabodhashram is taken to be 25.06.1953. In suit no. 36/65, date of enthronement asShankaracharya was taken to be 25.06.1953, but his enthronement on the seat was not held valid asthe seat of Shanakaracharya was not vacant. On the aforesaid order, an appeal was filed; becauseaccording to law, an appeal is continuation of the suit; and right to appeal is a legal right in which,suit is heard again, wherein the order of subordinate Court can be upheld or set aside or remandedto the subordinate Court for rehearing. The order of the subordinate Court during pendency ofappeal is not final; rather, in case of disposal of the appeal on merits and demerits, order of thesubordinate Court merges into appellate order and the order passed in the appeal is the final one.Challenging the order passed in Suit no. 3/54, Appeal no. 385/62 was filed in the Hon'ble HighCourt, which was decided on 11.09.1973, whereas Swami Krishnabodhashram had died on10.09.1973. From this, it is clear that it was pending till the demise of Swami Krishnabodhashramand there was no final order until his being Brahmleen (left for heavenly abode). Suit no. 36/65 wasdecided on 01.09.1970, challenging which appeal was filed. According to law, appeal is thecontinuation of suit. The said appeal, remained pending till 29.08.1981, which according to paperSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/192no. 302 of the defendant got abated on account of Krishnabodhashram having died. From this, it isclear that the said appeal was not disposed of and remained pending till Swami Krishnabodhashramwas alive."Hkys gh Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dh e`R;q rd okn la[;k 36@65 esa ifkjr fu.kZ; dh vihy yfEcr Fkh vkSjmDr v/khuLFk U;k;ky; dk fu.kZ; vfUre ugh gqvk Fkk ysfdu v/khuLFk U;k;ky; }kjk okn foUnq la[;k 5o 7] 8 ds fuLrkj.k esa fu"d"kZ nsrs gq;s Lokeh d`".kcks/kkJe dks Lokeh czg~ekuUn dk f'k"; ugh ekukFkk rFkkk mUgsa ckgjh O;fDRk crk;k Fkk rFkk ;g Hkh fu"d"kZ ns fn;k Fkk fd f'k"; ds jgrs if.Mr lHkkckgjh O;fDRk dks ukfer ugh dj ldrh gS rFkk Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn dks muds okLrfod inP;qr Â¼ActualremovelÂ½ rd in ij jgus dk fu"d"kZ fn;k FkkA bl ckr dks /;ku esa j[krs gq;s D;ksafd fo}kuksa }kjkLokeh 'kkUrkuUn dk fuxzg igys gh fd;k tk pqdk Fkk blfy;s czg~ekUkUn ds ofj"B f'k";ksa esa ls LokehLo:ikuUn ljLorh dks 'kadjkpk;Z T;ksfr"ihB ds in ij vf/k"Bkfir djk fn;k x;kA tgkW rd okLrfod inP;qrÂ¼Actual removelÂ½ dk iz'u gS fdlh Hkh eBk/kh'k@VÂªLVh dks gVkus ds nks gh rjhds gSa ;fn mDrVÂªLVh }kjk /kkjk 92 flfoy izfdz;k lafgrk ds izko/kkuksa ds vUrxZr VÂªLV dh lEifRr dk nqfoZfu;ksxrFkk dqiz'kklu dk dk;Z fd;k gS rks mlds fo:) /kkjk 92 flfoy izfdz;k lafgrk ds rgr inP;qr djus gsrq oknyk;k tk ldrk gSA ysfdu ;fn 'akdjkpk;Z dh v;ksX;rk ds vk/kkj ij mls gVkuk gS rks eBkEuk;egkuq'kklue~ tSlk fd okn foUnq la[;k 2] 3] 4 esa fu"d"kZ fn;k tk pqdk gS euh"khx.k }kjk fuxzg djds;ksX; dks vf/k"Bkfir dj fn;k tk;sxkA blds fy;s dksbZ vuq"Bku dh vko';drk ugh gSA ;fn fo}kuksa }kjk;ksX; 'kadjkpk;Z dks vf/k"Bkfir dj fn;k x;k rks og iwoZ LFkkfir v;ksX; 'kadjkpk;Z dk fuxzg gksxk]mldk in~P;qr gksxkA okn la[;k 36@65 esa Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn dk vf/k"Bkiu oS/k ekuk x;k rFkk mudsinP;qr gksus rd muds in ij cus jgus dk fu"d"kZ fn;k x;k rFkk mijksDr okn esa izfroknhx.k dkvf/k"Bkiu rks ekuk x;k ysfdu eq[;r% rhu dkj.k ls vf/k"Bkiu voS/k ekukA 1&og Lokeh czg~ekuUn dsf'k"; ugha Fks] 2&xq: f'k"; ijEijk ds vuqlkj psyk gh 'kadjkpk;Z cu ldrk gS] 3&iafMr lHkk f'k"; ds jgrsckgjh O;fDr dks vf/k"Bkkfir ugh dj ldrhA tSlk fd okn la[;k 36@65 ds okn foUnq la[;k 5] 7 o 8 dsfu"d"kZ ls Li"V gsA mDr fu.kZ; esa fn;s x;s fu"d"kZ ds izdk'k esa tc fd 07-12-1973 rd mDr fu.kZ; dsfo:) vihy yfEcr Fkh rFkk v/khuLFk U;k;ky; dk vkns'k vfUre ugh Fkk] eBkEuk; egkuq'kklue~ esa nhx;h 'kfDr;ksa ds vk/kkj ij fo}kuksa }kjk tSlk fd bl okn ds okn foUnq la[;k 2] 3] 4 esa fu"d"kZ fn;k x;kgS Lokeh Lo:ikuUn dks 'kadjkpk;Z ds :i esa vf/k"Bkfir fd;k D;ksfd os Lokeh czg~ekuUn ljLorh dsofj"B f'k"; Fks blls xq: f'k"; ijEijk dks Hkh ekU;rk nh x;h rFkk Lokeh Lo:ikuUn ljLOkrh ds vf/k"Bkiuds lkFk gh Lokeh 'kkUrkUkUn ljLorh dk Lor% gh fuxzg@inP;qr gks x;kA^^ Despite the fact thatappeal against the order passed in the suit no. 36/65 was pending till death of SwamiKrishnabodhashram; and the decision of Court below had not become final. But the Court below,while deciding Issues no.5, 7 and 8, had not held Swami Krishnabodhashram as a disciple of SwamiShri Brahmanand Sarswati, and had held him as an outsider. The Court had also given the findingthat in the event of the avaialibility of a disciple, Assembly of Pandits (Pandit Sabha) cannotnominate an outsider and also recorded the finding for continuance of Swami Shantanand to holdthe office, till his actual removal. Considering this aspect, since Nigrah (abandonment) of SwamiShantanand had already been done by learned scholars, Swami Swaroopanand Sarswati who wassenior disciple of Swami Brahmanand was enthroned on the seat of Shankaracharya ofJytotispeetha. As far as actual removal is considered, there are two methods for removal of aMathadheesh/Trustee; if property of trust has been misappropriated and mismanaged, a suit can bebrought against him for his removal under section 92 CPC. But if a Shankaracharya has to beremoved on the ground of his disqualification, as held in the finding recorded on issues 2, 3 and 4,the eligible one shall be installed by the learned scholars after abandoning him in the manner asSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/193stipulated in Mathamaanay Mahanushasan. For this, there is no requirement of performance of anyritual. If a qualified Shankaracharya is enthroned by the learned persons, it will beabandonment/restriction of the disqualified Shankaracharya, and it will amount to his removalfrom the office. In suit no. 36 of 1965, finding was given that that the installation of SwamiShantanand was valid and he was allowed to continue at the seat till his removal, and in theaforesaid suit, the installation of the defendant though accepted, but it was termed invalid for threereasons, which are: (i) He was not a disciple of Swami Brahmanand Sarswati, (ii) As per themaster-disciple tradition, only a disciple can become a Shankaracharya, (iii) Council of learnedscholars cannot enthrone any outsider if a disciple is available, as is clear from the findings on issues5, 7 and 8 in the suit no. 36 of 1965. In the light of findings recorded in the aforesaid decision, whenthe appeal was pending till 07.12.1973 against the said decision, and the order of Court below hadnot become final, as concluded while recording findings on Issues no. 2, 3 and 4, SwamiSwaroopanand was installed as Shankaracharya by learned Scholars, exercising the powersconferred by Mathamanay and Mahanushasan, because he was senior disciple of SwamiBrahmanand Sarswati, thereby recognising Master-disciple tradition and the installation of SwamiSwaroopanand Saraswati automatically resulted in abandonment/ restriction (Nigrah)/dethronement of Swami Shantanand Saraswati." (English Translation by Court)402. Again for the purpose of answering Issue-9 with regard to the functioning of Swami KrishnaBodhashram from 25.06.1953 to 10.09.1973, Court below has merely proceeded to hold that since heactually functioned as Shankaracharya and therefore, has answered the said issue in favour of theplaintiff though the legal consequence of judgment dated 15.01.1970 in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965,in our view, could not have been ignored by Court below.

Whereas, it has been pleaded on behalf ofthe defendant that the aforesaid issue has been decided in Suit No. 36/1965.

In Suit No. 36/1965 alsoinstallation of Swami Krishnabodhashram Saraswati on 25.06.1953 has been admitted, though theCourt had given finding not to recognise his installation as valid on account of the office being notvacant, against which Swami Krishnabodhashram Saraswati filed an appeal.

Appeal is continuationof suit and is, in fact, rehearing of suit, wherein the order of Subordinate Court can be confirmed orreversed or can also be remanded to the Court below for rehearing.okn la[;k 3@1954 dh vihy la[;k 385@1962 fnukad 11-09-1973 dks [kkfjt dh x;hA ysfdu Lokehd`".kcks/kkJe ljLorh dh e`R;q mlls igys gh fnukad 10-09-1973 dks gks pqdh FkhA vFkkZr mudhe`R;q rd okn la[;k 3@1954 dk vkns'k vfUre ugh FkkA Appeal no. 385/1962 concerning Suitno.3/1954 was dismissed on 11.09.1973.

As it is apparent from perusal of the execution of Suit no.22/1977, filed by defendant, wherein it has been shown by the defendant himself that the appeal wasalso pending till 1977, and the aforesaid appeal abated in the year 1981. Whereas, during the deathof Swami Krishnabodhashram Saraswati had taken place on 10.09.1973 during pendency of appeal.From 25.06.1953 to 10.09.1973, till the date he passed away (Brahmaleen), neither there was anyfinal order to remove him from the office of Shankaracharya nor any execution proceedings wereinitiated by defendant till his death. The sole proceeding, which was taken against SwamiKrishnabodhashram Saraswati, was also rejected as evident from documents filed vide index paperno. 874 C. As far as the property of the Peeth is concerned, during this period, several propertieswere enrtered in the name of Swami Krishnabodhashram Saraswati as Shankaracharya and it is alsoclear from the 'relief' in Suit no. 36/1965 that he was functioning as a Shankaracharya and alsoholding Dand, Chhatra, Chanwar, and Singhasan; wherefor, a Suit for temporary injuction was filedby Swami Shantanand Saraswati, which remained pending till the death of SwamiKrishnabodhashram Saraswati.

We have no manner of doubt that aforesaid findings cannot be sustained and has to bereversed. We are giving our reasons as under.404. In order to hold that Shanta Nand Saraswati was not qualified having no knowledge ofSanskrit, Court below has relied on judgment in Original Suit No. 3 of 1954 completely forgettingthe basic principles that the suit filed under Section 92 was ultimately dismissed. Swami ShantaNand Saraswati being defendant therein could not have filed an appeal against mere finding, on anissue decided against him when suit is ultimately dismissed for the reason that appeal under Section96 CPC lies against decree and not against a mere finding. The aforesaid finding, if any, could nothave been read against Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati in any manner. Even it did not constituteres-judicata in view of Section 11 which provides that the matter must have been heard and finallydecided by Court.405. In Nana Tukaram Jaikar Vs. Sonabai Mahadav and others AIR 1982 Bom. 437, suit wasdismissed but on some issues, an adverse finding was recorded against defendant, hence Court heldthat such finding would not operate as res-judicata and could not have been appealed.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/197406. Therefore, a finding recorded against defendant, Swami Shantanand Saraswati, in Original SuitNo. 3 of 1954, which was ultimately dismissed, could not have been raised against him since issuedid not attain finality as plaintiff therein, against dismissal of suit did not proceed further anddefendant, against whom finding on a particular issue was recorded, could not have filed appeal byvirtue of Section 96 which permits appeal against decree and not finding. Hence, there was nofinality of judgment on this issue and Trial Court relying on this finding in O.S. 3/1954, which wasdismissed against Swami Shantanand, defendant therein, in order to read something against him,has clearly erred in law. This finding of Trial Court, therefore, has to be reversed. Law on this aspectis almost uniform and some of the authorities of different High Courts as also Privy Council takingthe same view are Raghu Nath Vs. Shib Charan Lal (1895) ILR 17 All 174, Nundo Lall Bhuttacharjeeand others Vs. Bidhoo Mookhy Debee 1886 ILR 13 Cal. 17, Waris Khan and Others Vs.Ahmadullakhan and others AIR 1952 Nag 238, Midnapur Zamindari Company Limited Vs. NareshNarayan Roy AIR 1922 PC 241, Ramaswami Reddi Vs. Talaivasal Marudai Reddi and others AIR1924 Mad 469, S.P.A. Annamalay Chetty vs. B.A. Thornhill AIR 1931 PC 263.407. Trial Court has also recorded a perverse finding that in Original Suit 36 of 1965 with regard toqualification of Swami Shantanand Saraswati no finding was recorded. In Original Suit 36 of 1965,issue 4 was clearly with respect to qualification of plaintiff therein, i.e., Swami ShantanandSaraswati, "whether he possesses requisite qualification to hold the office of Shankaracharya as laiddown in Mathamnay and Mahanushasan". Issue 4 therein reads as under:"4. Whether the plaintiff possesses the requisite qualifications for holding the office ofShankaracharya as laid down in Muttamanay and Mahanusashan?"408. Answering said issue, Civil and Sessions Judge, Allahabad in judgment dated 15.01.1970 heldas under:"It would thus appear that on the plaintiffs side there is the nomination in the will by Guru. Thatway his Guru found him as a proper disciple, the nomination implies that the late Jagatgurudetermined his qualifications and found him as Sat Shishya. Adding that circumstance as anadditional weight in the scale of evidence for the plaintiff, I am inclined to believe P.W. 4 PanditRam Khelawan Tripathi, P.W. 7 Dr. Jai Ram Mishra, P.W. 9 Sri Makhan Lal Kela, P.W. 10 Sri SaytaNand Gaur, P.W. 11 Brahmachari Shanker Lal, P.W. 14 Sri Ram Narain Dutt Pande, P.W. 15 SriKapildeo Tripathi and P.W. 16 Sri Anantanand Saraswati and hold that the plaintiff has thequalifications required for the office of the Shankaracharya.""In view of the above discussion my finding is that in view of the nomination as successor in the willof Swami Brhmanand Ji the late Jagadguru Shankaracharya the plaintiff does possess thequalification for holding the office of Shankaracharya as laid down in Muttamanay andMahanushasan. More over as a secular judge I have no right to interfere with the conscience of thetestator who nominated what he believed to be proper for administration of mutt in future, nor canthe Court sit in judgment of nomination."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/198409. Once a clear finding was recorded by Trial Court in Original Suit 36 of 1965, the observation byTrial Court in the present case that on qualification of Swami Shantanand Saraswati regardingknowledge of Sankrit, no specific finding is recorded, is thoroughly misconceived, misreading andshows that it has misdirected itself in making out a case of disqualification of Swami ShantanandSaraswati for installation as Shankaracharya when his qualification was duly endorsed whileadjudicating a specific issue made in this regard by Trial Court in Original Suit 36 of 1965. Theotherwise findings in judgment under appeal, therefore, has to be set aside.Effect of Abatement410. The finding of Trial Court that since appeal preferred by Swami Krishna Bodhashram againstjudgment dated 15.01.1970 in Original Suit 36 of 1965 stood abated, therefore, judgment did notattain finality and hence would be of no help to appellant and question, whether Swami KrishnaBodhashram was validly installed on 25.06.1953 or not can still be examined by it, in our view, isclearly erroneous and this finding has to be reversed. Sri Goel, in our view, has rightly submittedthat judgment in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965, even otherwise, has attained finality and resulted in adecree executable between the parties in the said suit, therefore, whatever, issues have been decidedtherein, could not have been re-agitated by plaintiff in the subsequent suit and in respect of thoseissues, former judgment would operate res-judicata; and, in any case, no issue could have beenallowed to be raised in subsequent suit which has effect of upsetting earlier final decree. In thisregard, Sri Goel advanced his submissions based on certain authorities throwing light on the effectof "abatement". We may consider those authorities also at this stage.411. The first authority in this regard is Sundar Pande and others Vs. Musammat Kumari 1919 (50)Indian Cases 935 (Alld.). This Court considered effect of death of sole plaintiff-respondent duringpendency of appeal when legal heirs were not brought on record in the context of Order 22 Rule 4and 11 C.P.C., 1908. Suit property was claimed to be stridhan of step-mother of plaintiff, MusammatKumari, who filed a suit for declaration of her title alleging that she inherited property upon deathof Musammat Moti Rani, her step-mother. She also claimed for possession. Suit was decreedwhereupon defendant filed First Appeal in High Court. During pendency of appeal,Plaintiff-respondent, Musammat Kumari died. Court referring to Order 22 Rule 4, held that it hasno power to declare that suit has abated. Reading Rule 11 alongwith Rule 4, and substituting word"respondent for defendant" and "appeal for suit", this Court held that under this Rule it has nopower to declare a suit as distinct from appeal to have abated in a case in which there was decreealready made before death of plaintiff. However, since execution of decree is also impossible whichwas obtained by deceased-plaintiff what Court should do in such case is to direct that having regardto events which have happened, appeal should be struck out from the file of pending cases.412. In Nathaniel Uraon Vs. Mahadeo Uraon and others AIR 1957 Patna 511, a suit for ejectment ofdefendants-8 to 11 was filed claiming that plaintiff and defendants-1 to 7 have joint possession asthere was no family partition and plaintiff and defendants-1 to 7 are descendants of commonancestor-Sukra. The disputed land comprised of Khata No. 141. It was ancestral raiyati land ofplaintiff and defendants-1 to 7, recorded jointly in their names or their ancestors in the record ofrights. Suit was mainly contested by defendants-8 and 9 who stated that they had purchased plotsSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/199no. 566 and 2489 from defendant-1 which was separate and exclusive property of defendant-1. Theydenied claim of joint possession or co-ownership pleading that there was a division about 30 yearsback between Sukra Uraon and his brothers. Defendants-2 to 7 supported plaintiff's case anddefendants-10 and 11 supported defence set up by defendants-8 and 9. Trial Court held that nodivision amongst ancestors of plaintiff and defendants-1 to 7 was proved and one co-sharer even ifhave separate possession of common land cannot alienate same to a third person as his ownexclusive property since it was a co-ownership land until a partition takes place. Relying onjudgment of this Court in Jamna Vs. Jhalli AIR 1920 All 111 and Mohammad Sher Khan Vs. BharatIndu AIR 1928 All 59, Trial Court decreed suit holding that defendant-1 could not have alienatedjoint land to defendants. Trial Court passed decree for joint possession of disputed land betweenplaintiff and defendants-1 to 7 and for ejectment for defendants-8 and 9. First Appeal under Section96 of CPC was filed by defendants-8 and 9 before District Judge who affirmed Trial Court's findingswith regard to factum that there was no partition by metes and bounds with respect to joint familyproperty but then relying on a decision of Patna High Court in Sat Narayan Singh Vs. Anant ProsadAIR 1919 Pat 549 and Ram Nandan Sahay Vs. Jai Gobind Pandey AIR 1919 Pat 445, Appellate Courtconcluded that co-owner would be held in joint possession alongwith transferer and transferree. Itaccordingly, modified decree of Trial Court by disallowing ejectment of defendants-8 and 9 and gaveplaintiff a decree for joint possession of plots no. 566 and 2489 with defendants- 1 to 9. One of theplaintiffs, Nathaniel Uraon, brought Second Appeal in High Court and co-plaintiff, Bhaura Uraonwas impleaded as one of the respondents. During pendency of appeal, defendant-9, before TrialCourt, died. There was no substitution. Second Appeal accordingly abated against defendant-9 anddismissed accordingly holding decree of lower Appellate Court final in respect of plot no. 2489which was transferred by defendant-1 to defendant-9. In respect of another plot relating todefendant-8, Patna High Court confirmed modified decree passed by First Appellate Court followingthe principle that a person can in law confer upon another person all the rights he possesses in lawbut not more. Court held that a co-owner can transfer his undivided share in the joint property byway of lease, sale, gift or otherwise. Patna High Court in Sat Narayan Singh Vs. Anant Prosad(supra) culled out following principles in deciding the matter:"(a) It is not trespass for one co-owner A either by himself or by his tenants to use the commonproperty in the natural and necessary course of use or enjoyment. The remedy of the other co-ownerB is to sue A, but not his tenants, for compensation according to his share, for the exclusive use ofthe common property by A.(b) A is entitled to protect himself in the profitable use of the land as to which he is accountable to B,but he is not entitled to exclude B or his tenants from entering the land and carrying on agriculturaloperations in a way consistent with the continuance of the joint ownership and possession.(c) As a necessary corollary, B or his tenants is or are entitled to maintain a suit for joint possessioneither with A or his tenants, unless such joint possession interferes with the profitable use of theland by A or unless A or his tenants has or have improved the land to the knowledge of and withoutany objection by B."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/200413. In State of Punjab Vs. Nathu Ram AIR 1962 SC 89, certain land was acquired by PunjabGovernment which belong to Labhu Ram and Nathu Ram. They refused to accept compensationoffered by Collector and applied to Punjab Government through Collector under Rule 6 of PunjabLand Acquisition (Defence of India) Rules, 1943 (hereinafter referred to as "Rules, 1943"). Matterwas referred to Arbitrator under Rule 10 who made an award ordering a higher compensation thanwhat was offered by Collector. The award of Arbitrator was challenged by State Government inappeal before High Court. During pendency of appeal, Labhu Ram, one of the respondents, died.High Court took the view that since cause of action was common, appeal has abated against LabhuRam, hence its effect would be that it has also abated against Nathu Ram and consequentlydismissed the same. It also dismissed cross-objections filed by respondents. That is how mattercame up before Supreme Court. It held that with death of Labhu Ram, when no application forbringing on record his legal representatives was filed within the prescribed time, appeal of StateGovernment stood abated against Labhu Ram but C.P.C. does not provide for abatement of appealagainst other respondents. Court held that Order 22 Rule 4 does not provide for abatement ofappeal against co-respondents of deceased respondent as there can be no question of abatement ofappeal against them. This is a different thing that appeal against co-respondents cannot proceed incertain circumstances but it is not at par that appeal abates against them also. If Court can deal withthe matter in controversy, so far as regards the rights and interests of appellants and respondents,other than deceased respondent, it has to proceed with appeal and decide it. It is only to deal withsuch matters which cannot proceed that it will have to refuse to proceed further with appeal andtherefore would dismiss it. When a Court cannot proceed with the matter depends on the facts ofeach case and no exhaustive statement can be made about such circumstances. Some suchcircumstances were noticed by Court in para 6 of judgment as under:-"It may, however, be stated that ordinarily the considerations which weigh with the Court indeciding upon this question are whether the appeal between the appellants and the respondentsother than the deceased can be said to be properly constituted or can be said to have all thenecessary parties for the decision of the controversy before the Court. The test to determine this hasbeen described in diverse forms. Courts will not proceed with an appeal (a) when the success of theappeal may lead to the Court's coming to a decision which be in conflict with the decision betweenthe appellant and the deceased respondent and therefore which would lead to the Court's passing adecree which will be contradictory to the decree which had become final with respect to the samesubject matter between the appellant and the deceased respondent; (b) when the appellant could nothave brought the action for the necessary relief against those respondents alone who are still beforethe Court and (c) when the decree against the surviving respondents, if the appeal succeeds, beineffective, that is to say, it could not be successfully executed."414. Thereafter, Court examined the question as to appeal could have survived againstco-respondents after death of Labhu Ram and held it cannot. Reasons recorded in para 9 ofjudgment reads as under:-"The result of the abatement of the appeal against Labhu Ram is therefore that his legalrepresentatives are entitled to get compensation on the basis of this award, even if they are to bepaid separately on calculating their rightful share in the land acquired, for which this compensationSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/201is decreed. Such calculation is foreign to the appeal between the State of Punjab and Nathu Ram.The decree in the appeal will have to determine not what Nathu Ram's share in this compensationis, but what is the correct amount of compensation with respect to the land acquired for which thiscompensation has been awarded by the arbitrator. The subject matter for which the compensation isto be calculated is one and the same. There cannot be different assessments of the amounts ofcompensation for the same parcel of land. The appeal before the High Court was an appeal against adecree jointly in favour of Labhu Ram and Nathu Ram. The appeal against Nathu Ram alone cannotbe held to be properly constituted when the appeal against Labhu Ram had abated. To get rid of thejoint decree, it was essential for the appellant, the State of Punjab, to implead both the joint-decreeholders in the appeal. In the absence of one joint-decree holder, the appeal is not properly framed. Itfollows that the State appeal against Nathu Ram alone cannot proceed." (emphasis added)415. The above judgment was followed in Rameshwar Prasad and others Vs. Shyam BeharilalJagannath and others AIR 1963 SC 1901 and therein when reliance was sought under Order 41 Rule4, Court held that provisions of Order 41 Rule 4 C.P.C. would not over-ride provisions of Order 22Rule 9 C.P.C. The provisions of Order 41 Rule 4 C.P.C. applies at the time of appeal but once appealhas been filed, provisions of Order 41 Rule 4 C.P.C. would become unavailable. Order 22 operatesduring the pendency of an appeal and its institution. If some party dies during pendency of appeal,his legal representatives have to be brought on record within the period of limitation. If that is notdone, appeal by deceased-appellant abates and does not proceed any further. Order 22 Rule 9 andOrder 41 Rule 4 C.P.C. are, therefore, neither inconsistent nor apply to the same proceedings butthey operate at different stages and provide for different contingencies. There is nothing common inthese provisions which make the provisions, of one, interfere in any way with another.416. The two judgments relied by Shri Goel though observe that death of one of the parties wouldabate appeal and confer finality to judgment, decree under appeal but actually real issue raisedtherein was in respect of continuance of cause of action in respect of other co-appellants orco-respondents in the light of Order 22 Rule 4. These decisions, therefore, do not help the appellantin respect to the issue in question.417. In Bibi Rahmani Khatoon and others Vs. Harkoo Gope and others (1981) 3 SCC 173, a title suitwas filed by Bibi Rahmani Khatoon and others for declaration of their possession, title and forrecovery of possession of agricultural lands comprising two holdings bearing Khata Nos. 458, 459 inTouzi No. 7535 in Village Parsain. There were 7 defendants in suit. One defendant-7 Brahmadeoclaimed interest in Khata No. 458 on the basis of a sale deed dated 31.03.1959 executed bydefendant-5, Deonandan Singh. Suit was decreed by Trial Court declaring plaintiffs as owners inboth khatas and entitled to recover possession. First Appeal was dismissed by Fourth AdditionalDistrict Judge, Gaya and Trial Court's judgment was confirmed. During pendency of appeal beforeFirst Appellate Court, defendant-7, Brahmadeo, died. Neither his legal heirs were substituted noranybody came for substitution. Second Appeal was filed by another defendants, i.e., Harkoo Gopeand three others. When Second Appeal was pending, defendants-appellants also brought to thenotice of High Court, Patna that in view of Notification under Section 3 of Bihar Consolidation ofHoldings and Prevention of Fragmentation Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as "Act, 1956"), villagewas brought in consolidation operation, hence appeal pending in High Court would abate in view ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/202Section 4 of Act, 1956. It was accepted by High Court and appeal was disposed of, observing asunder:-"The appeal abates and judgments and decrees of both the Courts below are hereby set aside ashaving been abated."418. Since High Court declared even decree of Trial Court and First Appellate Court, abated, and setaside the same, plaintiffs brought appeal in Supreme Court. It was argued that by virtue ofNotification under Section 3 of Act, 1956 and by application of Section 4 of Act, 1956, only SecondAppeal would have abated hence High Court could not have set aside judgments and decrees of TrialCourt and First Appellate Court for the reason, when an appeal abates, judgment and decree ofCourt against which appeal is preferred becomes final. Another argument was that appellants inHigh Court had no interest in Khata No. 458 in which only defendant-7, Brahmadeo had claimed atitle and since he died when First Appeal was pending, against him First Appeal itself has abated.There was no issue with respect to said Khata before High Court and to that extent, decree of Courtbelow could not have been set aside by High Court. Supreme Court examined effect of Section 4 ofAct, 1956 and held that pending Second Appeal in High Court would abate. Then it proceeded toexamine correctness of order of High Court setting aside decree of Courts below on the ground thatproceedings have abated. Court held that concept of 'abatement' is known to civil law. If a party to aproceeding, either in Trial Court or appeal or revision, dies and right to sue survives or a claim hasto be answered, heirs and legal representatives of deceased party would have to be substituted andfailure to do so would result in abatement of proceedings. If a party to a suit dies and abatementtakes place, suit would abate. If a party to an appeal or revision dies and either appeal or revisionabates, it will have no impact on judgment, decree or order against which appeal or revision ispreferred. Such judgment, decree or order under appeal or revision would become final.419. But then Court distinguished above principle in the light of scheme of Act, 1956. It construedthe concept of "abatement" under Section 4 of Act, 1956 and held that the judgment if held final,then it will be binding on Consolidation authorities also and that will create obstruction inconsolidation proceedings for the reason that party whose appeal and revision would abate wouldlose its chance of persuading Consilidation authorities. Court thus said, "Therefore, the legislatureintended that not only appeal or revision would abate but judgment, order or decree against whichappeal is pending would also become non est as they would also abate and this would leaveconsolidation authority free to adjudicate the claims or title or other rights or interest in landinvolved in consolidation." Accordingly, it upheld the order passed by High Court.420. In taking above view, Court relied on its earlier judgments in Ram Adhar Singh Vs. RamroopSingh AIR 1968 SC 714 and Chattar Singh Vs. Thakur Prasad Singh AIR 1975 SC 1499 which hadarisen from pari materia provision i.e. Section 5 of Uttar Pradesh Consolidation of Holdings Act,1953 (hereinafter referred to as "Act, 1953"). Court, therefore, crystallized the principle in thecontext of 'abatement' under Section 4 of Act, 1956 as under:-"Accordingly, both on principle and precedent it is crystal clear that where a notification is issuedbringing the land involved in a dispute in the civil proceeding under a scheme of consolidation, theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/203proceedings pending in the civil Court either in the trial Court, appeal or revision, shall abate as aconsequence ensuing upon the issue of a notification and the effect of abatement would be that thecivil proceeding as a whole would come to a naught. Therefore, the order of the High Courtimpugned in this appeal is legal and valid so far as it not only directed abatement of the appealpending before the High Court but also abating the judgments and decrees of the trial Court and thefirst appellate Court because the entire civil proceeding came to naught." (emphasis added)421. In Amba Bai and others Vs. Gopal and others (2001) 5 SCC 570, a more interesting questionhad arisen. A suit for specific performance was filed by one Laxmi Lal, sole plaintiff, against RadhuLal, sole defendant, Suit was dismissed. First Appeal of plaintiff was allowed and suit was decreed.Sole defendant, Radhu Lal preferred Second Appeal against decree of First Appellate Court. Duringpendency of Second Appeal, sole defendant/appellant-Radhu Lal, died on 14.12.1990. Neither legalrepresentatives of sole defendant/appellant sought their substitution nor the factum of death ofRadhu Lal was brought to the notice of High Court, when appeal came up for hearing on 23.05.1991and the same was dismissed on merits. Decree of First Appellate Court, was put in execution. Legalrepresentatives of Radhu Lal resisted execution holding that order dated 23.05.1991 passed by HighCourt dismissing Second Appeal was a nullity, having been passed against a dead person and therewas a merger of judgment of First Appellate Court in the order of Second Appellate Court hence, itcould not have been executed. Executing Court rejected objection holding that there was no merger.High Court did not pass any decree and it is the First Appellate Court's decree which was executable.Said order of Executing Court was challenged in revision before High Court which was allowed andlearned Single Judge of High Court held that order passed in Second Appeal was a nullity as it wasagainst a dead person and decree of First Appellate Court had merged with judgment of SecondAppellate Court. Therefore, there was no question of any execution and execution proceedings wereliable to be rejected. This order was challenged by legal representatives of Radhu Lal in SupremeCourt. It observed that so far as order dated 25.03.1991 is concerned, same being a judgment againsta dead person, was a nullity. But then it also held that since Radhu Lal had died on 14.12.1990 andwithin 90 days, substitution was not sought, appeal stood abated by operation of law and that beingso, question of merger would not arise in this case. Court held that effect of abatement is that decreepassed by First Appellate Court acquired finality. For this purpose, it relied on earlier decisions inRajendra Prasad Vs. Khirodhar Mahto 1994 Supp (3) SCC 314 and also Bibi Rahmani Khatoon andothers Vs. Harkoo Gope and others (supra). Considering the concept of merger, Court held thatjudgment and order of an inferior Court is subjected to an appeal or revision by superior Court andin such proceedings, order or judgment, if passed by superior Court, determining rights of parties, itwould supersede order or judgment passed by inferior Court. A juristic justification for suchdoctrine of merger is based on the common law principle that there cannot be at one and the sametime, more than one operative order governing subject matter. Judgment of inferior Court isdeemed to lose its identity and merges with judgment of superior Court. However, when appealpending in superior Court abates, in absence of legal representatives of party who has died, decreepassed by inferior Court attained finality on its own since there was no other judgment of superiorCourt. Therefore, question of application of doctrine of merger does not arise. In the result,Supreme Court set aside order passed by High Court and confirmed Executing Court's order thatjudgment of First Appellate Court was executable.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/204422. In the aforesaid authorities and in particular in Bibi Rahmani Khatoon and others Vs. HarkooGope and others (supra) and Amba Bai and others Vs. Gopal and others (supra), in our view, the lawlaid down is that if a decree has been passed by Trial Court and defendant's appeal abates due todeath of sole defendant or defendants, the decree passed by Trial Court will remain operative and isnot abated except of the cases which are governed by special or specific statutory provisions, like,Section 5 of Act, 1953 and Section 4 of Bihar Act, 1956 whereunder entire civil proceedings willabate which would include not only the suit or decree passed therein but even appeal, revision etc.423. A distinction has been drawn between the abatement under the provisions of CPC and otherspecific statutory provision. Referring to the aforesaid decisions in the context of Bihar Act, 1956, inParas Nath Rai and others Vs. State of Bihar and others (2012 ) 12 SCC 642, Court has held thatonce a Notification has been published under Section 3 of Bihar Act, 1956 every suit and proceedingin respect of declaration of right or interest in any land lying in the area or for declaration oradjudication of any other right in regard to which proceedings can or ought to be taken, pendingbefore any Court or authority whether of the first instance or of appeal, reference or revision, shall,on an order being passed in that behalf by the Court or authority before whom such suit orproceeding is pending, shall stand abated with a view to ensure the jurisdiction of the authoritiesunder the Consolidation Act remain unhampered and the said authorities are not obstructed by theproceedings in civil Courts and their decisions are not impeded by the decisions of the civil Courts.Court clearly made a distinction between abatement under CPC and specific statutes and observed:" ... there is conceptual difference between statutory abatement and abatement under the Code ofCivil Procedure. On the basis of a statutory abatement, the whole proceeding from its inceptionstands abated because the local law has provided an effective alternative remedy to be persuadebefore an exclusive forum to remedy the grievance raised before the Court."424. In Mahendra Saree Emporium (II) VS. G.V. Srinivasa Murthy (2005) 1 SCC 481, the decisionsin Ram Adhar (supra), Chattar Singh (supra) and Mst. Bibi Rahmani Khatoon (supra) were referredto and distinguished on the ground that they relate to statutory abatement consequent upon anotification under the State consolidation of holding legislation having been issued and, therefore,when a pending appeal abates, it includes even the suit and decree passed therein since language ofstatute was wide enough, but that is not the situation in other matters. Court than said in para 13 ofthe judgment as under:"13. Abatement kills the right to sue and has the effect of unceremoniously terminating the pendinglegal proceedings without adjudication on merits. It has to be strictly construed and applied only tosuch cases to which its applicability is undoubtedly attracted. Excepting where an otherwiselegislative intention is expressly or by necessary implication deducible, a provision for abatement ofpending proceedings shall abate only such proceedings as were pending on that day and at thatstage and not the original proceedings which had already stood concluded but were reopened by asuperior forum for the purpose of examining legality or propriety thereof."425. The effect of abatement of appeal arising from judgment and decree passed in Original suit No.36 of 1965, thereafter, abated only appeal on account of death of defendant-appellant butSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/205plaintiff-respondent, who was alive and had a decree in his favour, was entitled to enjoy fruits ofdecree which remained operative.426. For the reason aforesaid we uphold the submission of Sri Goel and hold that judgment anddecree dated 15.07.1970 attained finality and issue returned therein could not have been reagitatedby plaintiff in subsequent suit when parties in earlier suit, whose rights are being disputed, are notbefore Court in subsequent proceedings and among those parties judgment had attained finalityvide judgment and decree dated 15.01.1970, after dismissal of appeal as abated.Whether judgment dated 15.01.1970 would operate as res judicata:427. First we proceed to discuss the question of res judicata of the judgment dated 15.06.1970 inOriginal Suit No. 36 of 1965.428. On behalf of appellant it is pleaded that installation of Swami Santanand Saraswati andexecution of Will dated 18.12.1952 by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati could not have been reagitatedby plaintiff-respondent since both these issues have already been adjudicated in Misc. Case No. 44of 1953 and Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 hence judgment dated 12.12.1955 and 15.01.1970 wouldoperate as res judicata. It was not open to Trial Court to reagitate the issues already determined inaforesaid two judgments as the same operate as res judicata under Section 11 read with ExplanationVI CPC as also barred by Order II Rule 2 read with Order VI Rules 2 and 4 CPC.429. The submission of Sri Manish Goel, learned counsel for appellant, is that the said judgmentoperates as res judicata in respect of declaration of alleged installation of Swami KrishnaBodhashram invalid and installation of Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati as valid and that being so,plaintiff in the present case claiming his right after demise of Swami Krishna Bodhashram causingseat of Shankaracharya vacant, which it did not and therefore entire suit is liable to be dismissed forthis reason alone. The argument of learned counsel for plaintiff obviously is that plaintiff was not aparty in the aforesaid suit and the suit having resulted in abatement of appeal, therefore findingtherein cannot be said to have become final.430. With regard to genuineness of Will dated 18.12.1952 we find that issue no. 2 was formulated byCourt below as under:"2(a). Whether late Swami Brahmanand Saraswati executed a Will dated 18.12.1952 as alleged bythe plaintiff in his favour? If so, had he a right to nominate his successor as alleged?(b) In case the Will dated 18.12.1952 is proved to have been executed was it obtained by the plaintiffunder the conditions as alleged in paragraph-31 to 33 of the written statement?"431. Trial Court on the question of Will has observed that its genuineness was already determined inits favour in a matter where plaintiff-respondent was also a party and he also being the President ofinterim committee was well aware of said Will, hence its genuineness cannot be doubted. Therefore,in the present case neither Will executed in 1952 can be challenged nor it can be examined, whetherSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/206Swami Santanand Saraswati had knowledge of Sanskrit or not. Findings to this effect recorded byCourt below on page 274 Vol. I of APB, read as under:^^oknh }kjk bl okn esa Hkh olh;r fnukad 18-12-52 dks pqukSrh nh gS tc fd U;k;ky; bl okn esa bl ijfu.kZ; nsuk mfpr ugha le>rh gS vkSj u gh 1952 dh olh;r dks bl okn esa pqukSrh nh tk ldrh gS vkSj ugh bl okn esa ;g ns[kk tk ldrk gS fd Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn dks laLd`r dk Kku Fkk fd ughaA** "Will dated18.12.1952 has been challenged by plaintiff in this suit whereas The Court does not consider itproper to render decision on this point and neither a Will of 1952 can be challenged in this suit nor itcan be adjudicated in this suit, whether Swami Shantanand had or had not knowledge of Sanskritlanguage." (English translation by Court)432. Trial Court thereafter has proceeded to examine whether plaintiff-respondent was installed asSankaracharya of Jyotishpeeth/Jyotirmath on 07.12.1973 and answered this question in favour ofplaintiff. For our purposes at this stage suffice it to notice that Trial Court in the present case did nottouch the genuineness of Will or installation of Swami Santanand as Sankaracharya after death ofSwami Brahmanand Saraswati and there is no cross appeal by plaintiff-appellant on this aspect, wefind no reason to proceed to decide the matter treating said Will to have been proved finally asgenuine one and has its natural and legal consequences, as the case may be.433. On the question of judgment dated 15.01.1970 passed in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 it has tobe examined whether it will operate as res judicata in the suit in question so as to non suitplaintiff-respondent or not.434. Before coming to factual aspect of the matter, we find it appropriate to have a bird eye view onthe concept of principle of res judicata as has been known in law.435. The legislative history involving the principle of res judicata brings us to the first codified civilprocedure i.e. Act 8 of 1859, which was applicable to only the Mofussil Courts (i.e. the Courts of CivilJudicature not established by Royal Charter). Prior thereto, the procedure of Mofussil Courts wasregulated by Special Acts and Regulations, which after enactment of Act 8 of 1859 were repealed byAct 10 of 1861. Act 23 of 1861 further amended 1859 Act. Section 42 of Act 23 of 1861 gives shorttitle as 'Code of Civil Procedure' to parent Act 8 of 1859. In 1862, the Supreme Court and the Courtsof Sadar Diwani Adalat in Presidency Towns were abolished by the High Courts Act, 1861 andpowers of those Courts were vested in the Chartered High Courts. The Letters Patent of 1862establishing the High Courts extended the procedure of Act 8 of 1859 to these Courts. The Charter of1865 which empowered the High Courts to make Rules and Orders regulating proceedings in civilcases, required them to be guided, as far as possible, by the provisions of Code of 1859 andsubsequent amending Acts. Act 8 of 1859 was amended from time to time vide Act 4 of 1860, 43 of1860, 23 of 1861, 9 of 1863, 20 of 1867, 7 of 1870, 14 of 1870, 9 of 1871, 32 of 1871 and 7 of 1872. TheAct 8 of 1859, which we can term as the "first codified civil procedure", was repealed and substitutedby Act 10 of 1877, which may be termed as "second codified civil procedure". There were only twoamendments in this Act, vide Act 18 of 1878 and 12 of 1879. Within five years of the enactment ofthe second Code, this was also repealed and superseded by Act 14 of 1882, which can be treated as"third Code of Civil Procedure". It was also amended by Acts 15 of 1882, 14 of 1885, 4 of 1886, 10 ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/2071886, 7 of 1887, 8 of 1887, 6 of 1888, 10 of 1888, 13 of 1889, 8 of 1890, 6 of 1892, 5 of 1894, 7 of1895 and 13 of 1895. It was then superseded and substituted by the present Code, i.e., Act No. 5 of1908, which came into force on 1st January, 1909.436. All the four Codes were enacted with the preamble mentioning as an Act to consolidate and toamend the laws relating to procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature meaning thereby thelegislature all through intended to construe exhaustive enactments dealing with the matterspertaining to procedure of Courts in civil matters. To consolidate means to collect the statutory lawrelating to a particular subject and to bring it down to take in order that it may form a useful codeapplicable to the circumstances existing at the time when the consolidation is enacted as observedby the Privy Council in A.G. of Bengal Vs. Prem Lal Mullick (1895) ILR 22 Cal. 788 (PC). Same viewwas expressed by our full Bench also in Shantha Nand Gir Chela Vs. Basudevanand AIR 1930 Alld.225. The purport of such codification means that if the language of the statute is plain, simple andunambiguous, there may not be any occasion for the Court to have recourse to the earlier law but ifit is capable of more than one meaning, it is permissible to refer to the previous state of law so as toconstrue the provision correctly. A consolidating Act raises the presumption that it does not intendto alter the earlier law in its entirety unless the changes and alteration are such so as to show thatthe earlier law has been made redundant in its entirety.437. Principle of res judicata, as it stands today, we find has its origin and existence long backbesides any boundation of system of jurisprudence whether Hindu law, Muslim law, English law etc.We do not find any substantial change in the principle and the very basis of the concept which ifapplicable would have to be followed by a Court of law unless it can be shown that the principle ofres judicata, as is known, is not at all attracted in a given case. We find that the availability of theprinciple of res judicata existing in different systems of law has been very painstakingly traced bythe Hon'ble Judges of Lahore High Court in a Full Bench decision in Mussammat Lachhmi Vs.Mussammat Bhulli, 1927 ILR (VIII) 384 and it would be useful to have the benefit of such in depthstudy by reproducing the same as under :"In the mitakshra (Book II, Chap. I, Section V, verse 5) one of the four kinds of effective answers to asuit is "a plea by former judgment" and in verse 10, Katyayana is quoted as laying down that "oneagainst whom a judgment had formerly been given, if he bring forward the matter again, must beanswered by a plea of Purva Nyaya or former judgment" (Macnaughten and Colebrooke's translationpage 22). The doctrine, however, seems to have been recognized much earlier in HinduJurisprudence, judging from the fact that both the Smriti Chandrika (Mysore Edition, pages 97-98)and the Virmitrodaya (Vidya Sagar Edition, page 77) base the defence of Prang Nyaya (=formerdecision) on the following text of the ancient law-giver Harita, who is believed by some Orientaliststo have flourished in the 9th Century B.C. and whose Smriti is now extant only in fragments :-"The plaintiff should be non-suited if the defendants avers; 'In this very affair, there was litigationbetween him and myself previously,' and it is found that the plaintiff had lost his case".There are texts of Parsara (Bengal Asiatic Society Edition, page 56) and of the Mayukha (Kane'sEditiona, page 15) to the same effect.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/208Among Muhammadan law-givers similar effect was given to the plea of "Niza-I-munfasla" or "AmarMania Taqrir Mukhalif." Under Roman Law, as administered by the Proetors' Courts, a defendantcould repel the plaintiff's claim by means of "exceptio rei judicata" or plea of former judgment. Thesubject received considerable attention at the hands of Roman jurists and as stated in Roby's RomanPrivate Law (Vol. II, page 338) the general principle recognized was that "one suit and one decisionwas enough for any single dispute" and that "a matter once brought to trial should not be triedexcept, of course, by way of appeal".The spirit of the doctrine is succinctly expressed in the well known maxim "Nemo debet bis vexaripro eadem causa" (no one shall be twice vexed for the same cause). At times the rule worked harshlyon individuals (E.g., when the former decision was obviously erroneous) but its working wasjustified on the great principle of public policy "Interest rei publicant sit finis litium" (it is for thepublic good that there be an end of litigation).In some of these ancient systems, however, the operation of the rule was confined to cases in whichthe plaintiff put forward his claim to "the same subject matter with regard to which his request hadalready been determined by a competent Court and had passed into judgment". In other words, itwas what is described as the plea of "estoppel by judgment" or "estoppel by record", which wasrecognized and given effect to. In several European continental countries even now the rule is stillsubject to these qualifications, e.g., in the Civil Code of France, it is said "The authority of the thingadjudged (chose judge) has place only in regard to that which has constituted the object of ajudgment. It is necessary that the thing demanded be the same; that the demand be founded uponthe same cause; that it be between the same parties and found by and against them in the samecapacity."In other countries, and notably in England, the doctrine has developed and expanded, and the bar isapplied in a subsequent action not only to cases where claim is laid to the same property but also tothe same matter (or issue) as was directly and substantially in dispute in the former litigation. Inother words, it is the identity of the issue, which has already been "necessarily tried" between theparties and on which a finding has been given before, and not the identity of the subject matterwhich attracts the operation of the rule. Put briefly the plea is not limited to "estoppel by judgment"(or record), but is also extended to what is described as "estoppel by verdict". The earliestauthoritative exposition of the law on the subject in England is by Chief Justice DeGrey in theDuchess of Kingston Case (1), which has formed the basis of all subsequent judicial pronouncementsin England, America and other countries, the jural systems of which are based on or inspired byBritish Jurisprudence. In that case a number of propositions on the subject were laid down, the firstof them being that "the judgment of a Court of concurrent jurisdiction, directly upon the point, is asa plea a bar, or as evidence conclusive, between the same parties upon the same matter, directly inquestion in another Court."In British India the rule of res judicata seems to have been first introduced by section 16 of theBengal Regulation III of 1793, which prohibited the Zilla and City Courts "from entertaining anycause, which form the production of a former decree of the record of the Court, shall appear to havebeen heard and determined by any judge or any superintendent of a Court having competentSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/209jurisdiction". The earliest legislative attempt at codification of the law on the subject was, however,made in 1859, when the first Civil Procedure Code was passed. Section 2 of the Code barred thecognizance by Courts of suits based on the same cause of action, which had been heard anddetermined before by Courts of competent jurisdiction. It will be seen that this was only a partialrecognition of the English rule in so far as it embodied the principles relating to estoppel byjudgment (or record) only and did not extend to estoppel by verdict. In 1877 when the Code wasrevised, the operation of the rule was extended in section 13 and the bar was no longer confined tothe retrial of a dispute relating to the same cause of action but the prohibition equally appliedagainst reagitating an issue, which had been heard and finally decided between the same parties in aformer suit by a competent Court. The section has been amended and amplified twice again and hasassumed its present form in section 11 of the Code of 1908, the principal amendments which have abearing on the question before us, being (a) that the expression "former suit" was defined asmeaning a suit which has been first decided and not one which was first instituted, and (b) that thecompetence of a Court is not regulated by the course of appeal of the former suit but by its capacityto try the subsequent suit as an original Court.But although the Indian Legislature has from 1859 onwards made several attempts to codify the lawon the subject and the present section 11 is a largely modified and improved form of the originalsection 2 of Act VIII of 1859, it must be borne in mind that the section as even now enacted, is notexhaustive of the law on the subject, and the general principles of res judicata apply to matters onwhich the section is silent and also govern proceedings to which the section does not in termsapply."438. It is, thus, evident that Res judicata is a principle or doctrine or concept which is wellrecognized since ancient times. It is a principle of universal application treated to be a fundamentaland basic idea in every developed jural society. The very objective of adjudication of a dispute by anadjudicatory forum, whatever name it is called, is to bring to an end dispute or lis between theparties. The seed of justice, thus, aims to have every matter fairly tried once and, thereafter, furtherlitigation should be barred treating to be concluded for all times to come between the parties. So faras the dispute which has already been adjudicated, it is a rule common to all, well defined in acivilized system of jurisprudence that the solemn and deliberate sentence of law upon a disputedfact pronounced, after a proper trial, by its appointed organ should be regarded as final andconclusive determination of the question litigated and should set at rest, forever, the controversy.This rule which treats the final decision of a competent Tribunal as "irrefragable truth" was wellknown to Hindu and Mohammadan lawyers and jurists since long as the system is recognized inHindu as well as Muslim laws also.439. So far as Europe is concerned, it is mainly influenced with the legal system of Romanjurisprudence. This principle is one of the great gains of Roman jurisprudence carried to modernjural system of Europe. In the Anglo saxon jurisprudence, this principle is formerly based on anmaxim of Roman jurisprudence "interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium" (it concerns the state thatthere should be an end to law suits) and partly on the maxim "nemo debut bis vexari pro una ateadem cause (no man should be vexed twice over for the same cause). The Act 8 of 1859 providedthe principle of the res judicata in Section 2 which read as under :Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/210"The civil Court shall not take cognizance of any suit brought on or cause of action which shall havebeen heard and determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction in a former suit between the sameparties, or between parties under whom they claim."440. The principle of res judicata vide Section 2 of C.P.C., 1859 came to be considered before thePrivy Council in Soorjomonee Dayee Vs. Suddanund Mahapatter (1873) 12 BLR 304, 315 (P.C.). TheJudicial Committee said "We are of the opinion that Section 2 of the Code of 1859 would by nomeans prevent operation of the general law relating to res judicata founded on the principle "nemodebet bis vexari pro eadem causa".441. In Krishna Behary Ray Vs. Bunwari Lal Ray, (1875) 1 Cal. 144 (146), Privy Council whileconstruing the expression "cause of action" held that it cannot be interpreted in its literal andrestricted sense and if a material issue had been tried and determined between the same parties by acompetent Court, the same cannot be re-agitated again by the parties in a later suit who were alsopartied in the former suit.442. When this view was expressed in some other judgments also the legislature introduced thewords "matter directly and substantially in issue" in Section 13 in Act No. 10 of 1877 and 14 of 1882.In Act No. 10 of 1877, it was Section 13 of the Code.443. In Parthasaradi Ayyangar and others Vs. Chinnakrishna Ayyangar and others Vol. V ILRMadras Series (1882) 304 an interesting question with respect to res judicata and estoppel byverdict and/or estoppel by judgment was considered. An original suit no. 12 of 1850 was institutedby certain persons of Tenkalai sect in the Court of Sadar Amin against the members of Vadakalaisect. A Vadakalai temple was erected in the village of Mathura Mangalam in the honor of a devoteeEmbar in which the member of Tenkalai sect were interested in maintaining worship and indefending the privileges of the temple. The other sect, namely, Vadakalai, also erected a Vaishnavatemple on a private site in the Sanadi (temple) street in honor of a devotee, Vedhanta Desikar, whichwas later on thrown open for regular public worship. In 1849 the above mentioned suit was filedpraying that the Vadakalais be compelled to remove their idols and be prohibited from celebratingfestivals and erecting any temple in the village for the worship of their idols. The Vadakalais,defended the suit contending that the general right of owners of land to erect on their own property,places of public worship and to set up therein such idols as they thought fit. Earlier to that suit, itappears that there was some other suit between the same sects wherein the Pandit had delivered anopinion that the public worship of idols of devotees such as the spiritual teachers of the respectivesects was not recognized by Hindu law, and that law did not permit persons to assemble together tocelebrate to such idols. But where it was customary to do so, such idols might be used in privateworship. Relying on the said opinion of the Pandit, the Sadar Amin granted the order of injunctionprayed for. In the appeal preferred before the Judge, he held that supposing the worship of whichthe Tenkalais complained was prejudicial to the interests of the institution they supported, thequestion being one of conscience, no cause of action accrued to the Tenkalais, and that it wascompetent to the Vadakalais to adopt the worship of what idols they pleased in pagodas erected ontheir own lands. It reversed the decree in so much it ordered the removal of the idols and prohibitedthe Vadakalais from erecting pagodas and celebrating public worship therein. But it found thatSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/211conduct of procession in honor of Vadakalai idols was an innovation, did not form an essential partof the worship, and might be productive of public disturbance, and, accordingly, passed an orderrestraining it. Noticing that this part of the order was beyond the relief sought in the plaint, anappeal was preferred before the Sadar Court. The Sadar Court sought for opinion of the Pandits ofthe Court with respect to Hindu law on the subject who opined that it would be contrary to customto allow a pagoda to be erected by the Vadakalai Vaishnavas even on their own ground if such anerection was against the feelings generally of the people of the village. He referred to a passage in thepreamble of the Mitakshara which declared that "no cases prejudicial to the feelings of theinhabitants of a town or village shall be entertained by a King". The Sadar Court accordingly decreedthat the defendants (the Vadakalais) should be prohibited from erecting temple or instituting publicworship on the spot of ground objected to by the plaintiffs and which lay within the range of theirtemple, that is to say, within the usual range of the processions conducted in connection with thetemple worship. In another appeal no. 141 of 1856, Sadar Court declared that the right to pass inprocession through the public streets of a town in such a way as the Magistrate might not object toas dangerous to the public safety, was a right inherent in every subject of the state and theVadakalais' action which continued was in disobedience as was restrained by the earlier decree andinjunction prohibiting decree was again passed in 1862. Thereafter, Vadakalais removed their idolsand erected a building for the purpose of worship on another site. No arrangement of celebration ofthe public worship was made till 1879 except of occasional processions. However, in 1879 againprovision was made for continuous conduct of such worship throughout the year. This led toanother suit which ultimately reached to the appellate Court. It was held that the decree in earliersuit cannot preclude the Vadakalais from building a temple or conduct public worship at any otherspot and plea of estoppel based on the earlier decisions was held to be inapplicable. The Court heldthat the matter in issue which was raised and decided in the former suit was not a question of factbut a question of law based on the opinion of Pandit which was found opposed to the law declared tobe the law of India under British administration. The Court held that the law of India under Britishadministration as declared is that the persons of whatever sect are at liberty to erect building andconduct public worship on their own land provided they neither invade the rights of propertyenjoyed by their neighbours nor cause a public nuisance, and that they are also entitled to conductreligious processions through public streets so that they do not interfere with the ordinary use ofsuch streets by the public and subject to such directions as the Magistrate may lawfully give toprevent obstructions of the thoroughfare or breaches of the public peace. The Court held that theprinciple of res judicata also would not come in way. The Courts are bound to ascertain and applythe law and not to make law. It observed that what was argued was estoppel by verdict and estoppelby judgment. Explaining the "estoppel by verdict", it was held that it indicates that such estoppelsare confined to questions of facts and no authority was cited before the Court to warrant theapplication of rule to determination of an issue of law. Explaining the principle of res judicata, theCourt observed, "Although considerations of convenience have established the rule that the finaldecree of a competent Court is decisive of the rights it declares or refuses notwithstanding it mayhave proceeded on an erroneous view of the law, and although the same considerations haveestablished the rule that the determination by a competent Court of questions of fact directly andsubstantially in issue are binding on the parties, these considerations do not suggest the expediencyof compelling the Courts to refuse to give effect to what they have ascertained to be the law."However, the Court also said that all earlier decisions were in respect of a different place and wouldSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/212not bar the subsequent suit which was in respect to another spot.444. In Ram Kirpal Vs. Rup Kuari (1883) ILR 6 (Alld.) 269 (P.C.) it was held that Section 13 of 1877Act would not apply to execution proceedings but upon general principles of law the decision of amatter once decided in those proceedings was a bar to the same matter being re-agitated at asubsequent stage thereof.445. Act 5 of 1908 contains the provision of res judicata under Section 11 which substantially is sameas it was in Act 14 of 1882, but includes certain explanations clarifying some aspects of the matterconsidered to be necessary in the light of some judgments of different High Courts. It has undergonesome amendments in 1976, but has withstood the test of the time more than a decade. Section 11 ofAct 5 of 1908, as it stands today, reads as under :"11. Res judicata.- No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantiallyin issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties, orbetween parties under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a Courtcompetent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised,and has been heard and finally decided by such Court.Explanation I- The expression "former suit" shall denote a suit which has been decided prior to thesuit in question whether or not it was instituted prior thereto.Explanation II.- For the purposes of this section, the competence of a Court shall be determinedirrespective of any provisions as to a right of appeal from the decision of such Court.Explanation III.- The matter above referred to must in the former suit have been alleged by oneparty and either denied or admitted, expressly or impliedly, by the other.Explanation IV.- Any matter which might and ought to have been made ground of defence or attackin such former suit shall be deemed to have been a matter directly and substantially in issue in suchsuit.Explanation V.- Any relief claimed in the plaint, which is not expressly granted by the decree, shall,for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been refused.Explanation VI- Where persons litigate bona fide in respect of public right or of a private rightclaimed in common for themselves and others, all persons interested in such right shall, for thepurposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the persons so litigating.Explanation VII.- The provisions of this section shall apply to a proceeding for the execution of adecree and reference in this section to any suit, issue or former suit shall be construed as references,respectively, to proceedings for the execution of the decree, question arising in such proceeding anda former proceeding for the execution of that decree.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/213Explanation VIII.-An issue heard and finally decided by a Court of limited jurisdiction, competent todecide such issue, shall operate as res judicata in as subsequent suit, notwithstanding that suchCourt of limited jurisdiction was not competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which suchissue has been subsequently raised."446. Explanations VII and VIII have been added by Amendment Act of 1976 and admittedly have noapplication to the dispute in hand.447. The plea of res judicata is an inhibition against the Court and a finding in favour of a party onthe plea of res judicata would oust the jurisdiction of the Court to try the subsequent suit or the suitin which such issue has been raised, which has been heard and finally decided in the former suit (see: Pandurang Dhondi Chougule Vs. Maruti Hari Jadhav AIR 1966 SC 153. Since, it restrains the Courtto try the subsequent suit or an issue raised subsequently, we have no manner of doubt that for thepurpose of present case, it is the provision contained in Section 11 of Act 5 of 1908, which willgovern the matter and not the earlier one. The application of principle of res judicata is based onpublic policy and in the interest of the State as well. However, we would like to clarify here itself thatwe may not be understood as observing that the principle of res judicata is confined to Section 11 ofthe Act 5 of 1908. As we have already held, the principle of res judicata was well recognized in theancient legal systems also and it has consistently been held as not limited to the specific words of theCode for its application.448. One of the oldest case which considered the doctrine of res judicata vide Section 11, CPC, 1908is Sheoparsan Singh and others Vs. Ramnandan Prasad 43 IA 91(PC)= 20 C.W.N. 738 (P.C.)wherein their Lordships reminded the dictum in the words of Lord Coke in Priddle Vs. Napper 6Coke IA 1777 which said "Interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium", otherwise great oppression mightbe done under colour and pretence of law. (See also Commissioner of Central Excise Vs. ShreeBaidyanath Ayurved Bhawan Ltd. JT 2009 (6) SC 29).449. The statement of law as propounded in Sheoparsan Singh (supra) has been approved by theApex Court in Iftikhar Ahmed Vs. Syed Meharban Ali 1974 (2) SCC 151.450. Then comes Hook Vs. Administrator General of Bengal 1921 (ILR) 48 (Cal.) 499 (P.C.) whereinit was said that Section 11 of the Code is not exhaustive of the circumstances in which an issue is resjudicata. Even though the Section may not apply, the plea of res judicata still would remainoperative apart from the limited provisions of the Code, and would bar a subsequent suit on thesame issue unless is shown to be inapplicable by the defendants referring to pleading, parties andcause of action etc. It was reaffirmed by Lord Buckmaster in T.B. Ramachandra Rao and another Vs.A.N.S. Ramchandra Rao and others, AIR 1922 PC 80 wherein the remarks were "that the principlewhich prevents the same case being twice litigated is of general application, and is not limited by thespecific words of the Code in this respect."451. In Kalipada De Vs. Dwijapada Das, AIR 1930 PC 22 the Privy Council held "the question as towhat is considered to be res judicata is dealt with by Section 11 of CPC 1908. In that section manyexamples and circumstances in which the rule concerning res judicata applies are given; but it hasSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/214often been explained by this Board that the terms of Section 11 are not to be regarded as exhaustive".452. In Gulam Abbas Vs. State of U.P., AIR 1981 SC 2199 it was held that Section 11 is not exhaustiveof the general doctrine of res judicata. Though the rule of res judicata as enacted in Section 11 hassome technical aspects, the general doctrine is founded on consideration of high public policy toachieve two objectives namely that there must be a finality to litigation and that individuals shouldnot be harassed twice over the same kind of litigation.453. It is thus clear that principle of res judicata is based on sound policy and not an arbitrary one.Henry Campell Black in his Treatise "for law of judgments" 2nd Edition Vol. I, para 242 hasobserved that "Where the Court has jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter in theparticular case, its judgment unless reversed or annulled or impeachment by parties or privies, inany collateral action or proceeding whatever the Doctrine of this Court, and of all the Courts of thiscountry, is formerly established, that if the Court in which the proceedings took place hadjurisdiction to render the judgment which it did no error in its proceedings which did not affect thejurisdiction will render the proceedings void, nor can such errors be considered when the judgmentis brought collaterally into question one. This principle is not merely an arbitrary rule or law but it isa doctrine which is founded upon reason and the soundest principle of public policy."454. In Jenkins Vs. Robertson, (1867) LRIHL 117 Lord Romily observed "res judicata by its verywords means a matter upon which the Court has exercised its judicial mind and has come to theconclusion that one side is right and has pronounced a decision accordingly. In my opinion resjudicata signifies that the Court has after argument and considerations come to a decision on acontested matter."455. In Corpus Juris Vol. 34 it is said that it is a rule of universal law providing every regulatedsystem of jurisprudence and is put upon two grounds embodied in various maxims of common law,the one of public policy and necessity which makes it to the interest of the state that there should bean end of litigation, and, the other, hardship on the individual that he should not be vexed twice forthe same cause.456. The Apex Court in Smt. Raj Lakshmi Dasi and others Vs. Banamali Sen and others AIR 1953 SC33 remarked "When a plea of res judicata is founded on general principles of law, all that isnecessary to establish is that the Court that heard and decided the former case was a Court ofcompetent jurisdiction. It does not seem necessary in such cases to further prove that it hasjurisdiction to hear the later suit. A plea of res judicata on general principle can be successfullytaken in respect of judgments of Courts of exclusive jurisdiction, like revenue Courts, landacquisition Courts, administration Courts, etc. It is obvious that these Courts are not entitled to try aregular suit and they only exercise special jurisdiction conferred on them by the statute.457. In Lal Chand Vs. Radha Kishan, AIR 1977 SC 789=1977(2) SCC 88 the Apex Court reiterated"the principle of res judicata is conceived in the larger public interest which requires that all thelitigation must sooner than later come to an end. The principle is also founded on equity, justice andgood conscious which require that a party which has once succeeded on a issue should not beSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/215permitted to be harassed by a multiplicity of proceedings involving the same issue".458. In K. Ethirajan Vs. Lakshmi and others, AIR 2003 SC 4295 the Apex Court refering to para 26of its earlier judgement in Hope Plantations Ltd. Vs. Taluk Land Board, Peermade, JT 1998 (7) SC404 held that rule of res judicata prevents the parties to a judicial determination from litigating thesame question over again. Where the proceedings have attained finality, parties are bound by thejudgement and cannot litigate again on the same cause of action.459. In Sulochana Amma Vs. Narayanan Nair, AIR 1994 SC 152 the scope of Section 11 CPC wasconsidered and it was said that Section 11 does not create any right or interest in the property butmerely operates as a bar to try the same issue once over. It aims to prevent multiplicity of theproceedings and accords finality to an issue which directly and substantially has arisen in the formersuit between the same parties or their privies, decided and became final so that parties are not vexedtwice over; vexatious litigation would be put to an end and the valuable time of the Court is saved.The above judgement also clarifies Explanation VIII that the decree of a Court of limited jurisdictionwould also operate as res judicata in the subsequent suit though the subsequent suit was not triableby that Court.460. Recently the Apex Court has reiterated the above view in Brij Narain Singh Vs. Adya Prasad, JT2008 (3) SC 1.461. The doctrine of res judicata has been extended to public interest litigation also in State ofKarnataka and another Vs. All India Manufacturers Organization and others, 2006(4) SCC 683 andthe Court has said:"As a matter of fact, in a public interest litigation, the petitioner is not agitating his individual rightsbut represents the public at large. Hence the litigation is bona fide, a judgement in previous publicinterest litigation would be a judgement in rem. It binds the public at large and bars any member ofthe public from coming forward before the Court and raising any connected issue or an issue, whichhad been raised should have been raised on an earlier occasion by way of public interest litigation."462. In Mathura Prasad Sarjoo Jaiswal and others Vs. Dossibai AIR 1971 SC 2355, the Courtclarified that the doctrine of res judicata is in the domain of procedure and cannot be exalted to thestatus of a legislative direction between the parties so as to determine the question relating tointerpretation of the enactment affecting the jurisdiction of the Court finally between them eventhough no question of fact or mixed question of law and fact and relating to the right in issuebetween the parties once determined thereby. It also said that a decision of a competent Court on amatter in issue may be res judicata in another proceeding between the same parties; the "matter inissue" may be an issue of fact, an issue of law or one of mixed law and fact. However, the Apex Courtsaid that the previous decision on a matter in issue alone is res judicata; the reasons for the decisionare not res judicata, and said as under :"The previous decision on a matter in issue alone is res judicata; the reasons for the decision are notres judicata."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/216463. Another aspect as to when the rule of res judicata would not be attracted has been dealt with indetail in para 10 of the judgment in Mathura Prasad Serjoo Jaiswal (supra) which reads as under :"A mixed question of law and fact determined in the earlier, proceeding between the same partiesmay not, for the same reason, be questioned in a subsequent proceeding between the same parties.But where the decision is on a question law, i.e. the interpretation of a statute, it will be res judicatain a subsequent proceeding between the same parties where the cause of action is the same, for theexpression "the matter in issue" in S. 11, Code of Civil Procedure, means the right litigated betweenthe parties, i.e. the facts on which the right is claimed or denied and the law applicable to thedetermination of that issue. Where, however, the question is one purely of law and it relates to thejurisdiction of the Court or a decision of the Court sanctioning something which is illegal, by resortto the rule of res judicata a party affected by the decision will not be precluded from challenging thevalidity of the order under the rule of res judicata, for a rule of procedure cannot supersede the lawof the land."464. In other words, what we discern from the above authorities, is that the res judicata is afundamental principle in a legal system to set at rest a dispute once settled so as not to trouble theparties again and again on the same matter. It operates on the principle that a question must beonce fairly and finally tried by a competent Court and, thereafter, further litigation about it betweenthe same parties must be deemed to have concluded and should not be allowed to be re-agitated.The maxim to be attracted is "no one shall be vexed twice over the same matter". [See ShreeBaidyanath Ayurved Bhawan Ltd. (supra)].465. It is not that every matter decided in a former suit can be pleaded as res judicata in asubsequent suit. To attract the plea of res judicata, the conditions precedent, which need to beproved are :1. The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must be the same matter,which was directly and substantially in issue, either actually or constructively, in the former suit.2. The former suit must have the same parties or the parties under whom they or any of themclaims.3. The parties must have litigated under the same title in the former suit.4. The Court, which decided the former suit must have been a Court competent to try thesubsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised.5. The matter directly and substantially in issue in the subsequent suit must have been heard andfinally decided by the Court in the first suit.466. In Syed Mohd. Salie Labbai Vs. Mohd. Hanifa AIR 1976 SC 1569, the Apex Court said that inattracting the plea of res judicata the following conditions must be proved :Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/2171. that the litigating parties must be the same;2. that the subject-matter of the suit also must be identical;3. that the matter must be finally decided between the parties; and4. that the suit must be decided by a Court of competent jurisdiction.467. In certain cases, the applicability of res judicata qua the aforementioned conditions precedentcame to be considered with certain different angles, which may be useful to be referred hereat.468. One such aspect came to be considered by the Privy Council in Midnapur Zamindary Co. Ltd.Vs. Kumar Naresh Narayan Roy and others, AIR 1924 P.C. 144 which is also a decision cited by SriSiddiqui. The plaintiff excluded certain question by the statement of his pleader and, therefore, thetrial Court did not decide the issue. In the first appeal the defendant urged that the Trial Judge waswrong in not deciding this question even though his action was based on the plaintiff's advisor'sstatement and the defendant asked the first appellate Court expressly to decide the question. TheCourt did so. The question was whether it can be argued that the point decided was not raised and,therefore, the Court did not consider it to be a necessary issue. On the contrary when the firstappellate Court decided the issue and the same became final, it would operate as res judicata to thesubsequent suit involving the same issue.469. Another angle of the above aspect came to be considered by the Privy Council in Prem NarainVs. Ram Charan and others, AIR 1932 P.C. 51 where though the point was not properly raised in theplaint but both parties without protest chose to join issue upon that point and it was held that thedecision on the point would operate as res judicata between the parties.470. In Jagdeo Misir Vs. Mahabir Tewari, AIR 1927 All. 803 a Division Bench of this Court held:"We think that those two cases are authorities for the proposition that if a party raised an issue,however improperly, in a case which is accepted by the other side and if the Court itself accepts theissue to be one relevant to the enquiry and necessary for the determination of the case, and thatissue is argued out by both parties and a judicial decision come to, it is not open subsequently foreither of the parties or their successors-in-interest or the person claiming through them, to say thatthe issue does not constitute res judicata."471. This has been followed in Lalji Sahib Vs. Munshi Lal, AIR 1943 All 340 and Dhan Singh Vs. Jt.Director of Consolidation, U.P. Lucknow and others, AIR 1973 All. 283.472. In Dhan Singh (supra) this Court also held that res judicata may apply even though the partiesagainst whom it is sought to enforce did not enter appearance and contest question in the previoussuit. But in such a case it has to be shown that such a party had notice that the relevant question wasin issue and would have to be decided for which the burden lie on the person who pleaded bar of resjudicata. For these propositions this Court followed and relied on Chandu Lal Vs. Khalilur Rahman,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/218AIR 1950 P.C. 17.473. The proposition advanced is that even if a judgement in a previous case is erroneous it would bebinding on the parties thereto and would operate as res judicata in subsequent case as held in GorieGouri Naidu (Minor) and another Vs. Thandrothu Bodemma and others, AIR 1997 SC 808 is wellsettled.474. In short, we can say that though in order to have the defence of res judicata accepted, it isnecessary to show not only that the cause of action was same, but also that the plaintiff had anopportunity of getting the relief in the former proceedings, which he is now seeking. In JaswantSingh Vs. Custodian of Evacuee Property 1985 (3) SCC 648 it was pointed out that the test iswhether the claim in the subsequent suit or proceeding is in fact founded upon the same cause ofaction, which was the foundation of the former suit or the proceeding. The cause of action for aproceeding has no relation, whatsoever, to the defence, which may be set up, nor does it dependupon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff or the applicant. It refers entirely to thegrounds set forth in the plaint or the application, as the case may be, as the cause of action or inother words, to the media upon which the plaintiff or the applicant ask the Court to arrive at aconclusion in his favour.475. In Talluri Venkata Seshayya and others Vs. Thadikonda Kotiswara Rao and others, AIR 1937P.C. page 1 we find that there was a case where five temples, subject matter of suit, were built in 19thCentury by one Thadikonda Seshayya a native of Vellatur and the grandfather of Kotiswara Raoadoptive father who is said to have earned wealth in Hyderabad and returned to his native place.The temples were built for the deities of Siddhi Ganapati Swami, Rajeswara Swami, BhimeswaraSwami, Adi Seshachala Swami and Kameswara Maharani. Sri Thadikonda Seshayya conducted thefestivals and other affairs of the deities during his life time. He left a will dated 26.08.1826 shortlybefore his death directing his widow, Adilakshmamma to make a permanent endowment for thetemples to the extent of Rs. 70,000/- out of his self acquired properties. The widow purchased twosets of properties in the villages of Kowtharam and Peddapulivarru for the temples, conducted theaffairs of temples out of the land so purchased, and afterwards made a formal gift of the lands to theidols. Another set of properties in the village of Vellatur was endowed to the same temples by theZamindar of Narasaraopet. Seshayya's two sons, Siddi Ganapati Doss and Nagabhushana GajananaDoss conducted festivals and other affairs until the death of Ganapati in 1857. The latter's widowclaimed the Dharmakartaship but the Collector decided in favour of Gajanana. In 1859 the InamCommissioner granted an Inam title deed in respect of the Devadayam Inam situated in the villageof Kowtharam. In 1867 Gajanana started borrowing money on the security of Devadayam lands,which culminated in a usufructuary mortgage for Rs. 8000/- dated 15.01.1887 under which thelands of Kowtharam were handed over to the mortgagee. To discharge this mortgage Gajanana andhis adopted sons Seshayya granted permanent lease of Kowtharam lands dated 06.12.1888 and onthe same date the mortgagee, Gopalkrishnamma executed the counterpart of the lease. Two personsinterested in the temples and in the performance of the service and worship thereof who hadobtained the leave of the Court under Section 18, Religious Endowments Act, 20 of 1863, on18.01.1891 filed suit O.S. No. 4 of 1891 in the District Court, Kistna against Gajanana, his adoptedson Seshayya and Gopalakrishna claiming that the five suit temples at Vellatur were public temples,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/219therefore, the first two defendants be removed from the office of the Dharmakarta. The maindefence taken by the defendants in the said suit was that the temples and lands were privateproperty hence Act, 20 of 1863 did not apply. Gajanana died during the pendency of suit. Videjudgment dated 05.02.1892 the District Judge Kistna dismissed suit holding that the temples wereprivate, lands were a private foundation and Act, 20 of 1863 did not apply. The judgment wasconfirmed by Madras High Court in appeal vide judgment dated 03.08.1893. One suit was filed byVenkata Seshayya and others on 21.08.1923 as representing the interested public under Order 1Rule 8 CPC with the requisite permission of the Subordinate Judge of Masaulipatam seeking adeclaration that five temples of the village of Vellatur, Guntur District are public temples and thatcertain Inam lands situated in Kowthavaram village form the endowment of these temples and,therefore, the plaintiff seeking setting aside of a permanent lease in respect of these lands executedon 06.12.1888 by the then Managers of the temples, the mortgage deed on the security of theselands dated 03.11.1900 and the Court sale effected in execution of the decree obtained on the basisof the said mortgage in O.S. No. 29 of 1911. They further seek restoration of possession of theselands to Kotiswara Rao, defendant no. 1 who is the person hereditary Dharmakartha of the temples.Before the Privy Council it was contended on behalf of the appellants conceding that the appellantsmust be deemed to be claiming under plaintiffs in 1891 suit within the meaning of Explanation VI,Section 11 CPC as they were both claiming as representing the public interest in the temples ofKowthavaram lands and the issue in the two suits was substantially same but it was submitted that1891 suit was not a bona fide litigation, there was gross negligence in the conduct of the suit by theplaintiff in 1891 suit, and, therefore, the principle of res judicata would not bar the present suit.Rejecting the submission, it was held that the provision of Section 11 CPC is mandatory and theordinary litigant who claims under one of the parties to the former suit can only avoid its provisionsby taking advantage of Section 44, Evidence Act which defines with precision the grounds of suchavoidance as fraud or collusion. The exposition of law stated therein need not be discussed furthersince it is consistent with what was held subsequently also as has been discussed by us above.476. During the course of argument, the learned counsel has pleaded and pressed plea ofmaintainability of suit on the ground of res judicata and estoppel, using both the term it appears tous interchangeably. However, we do not subscribe to the view since it is now well settled that thetwo are essentially different. It is true that sometimes res judicata has been treated as part of thedoctrine of the estoppel, but both have been held to be different in connotation, in application andwith reference to the essential indicias thereof.477. Both these principles are based on public policy and justice. Often they are treated as a branchof law having same traits but both differ in several aspects. Doctrine of res judicata some times isconstrued as a branch of doctrine of estoppel but as we said earlier both have different connotation.In Hope Plantations Ltd. (supra) in para 26 of the judgement the Apex Court said:"It is settled law that the principles of estoppel and res judicata are based on public policy andjustice. Doctrine of res judicata is often treated as a branch of the law of estoppel through these twodoctrines differ in some essential particulars..........."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/220478. The estoppel is part of the law of evidence and prevents a person from saying one thing at onetime and opposite thing at another time while res judicata precludes a man from avowing the samething in successive litigations. (Cassomally Vs. Carrimbhoy (1911) 36 Bom. 214; Radharani Vs.Binodamoyee AIR 1942 Cal. 92; Rajah of Venkatgiri Vs. Provinces of Madras AIR (34) 1947 Madras5. We find it useful to refer the distinction elucidated by Hon'ble Mahmood J. in Sitaram Vs. AmirBegum (1886) ILR 8 Alld. 324 "Perhaps shortest way to describe difference between the plea of resjudicata and estoppel is to say that while the former prohibits the Court from entering into aninquiry at all as to a matter already adjudicated upon, the later prohibits a party after the inquiry hasalready been entered upon from proving any thing which would contradict his own previousdeclaration or acts to the prejudice of another party who, relying upon those declaration or acts tothe prejudice of another party, has altered his position. In other words, res judicata prohibits aninquiry in limine, whilst an estoppel is only a piece of evidence".479. Res judicata has been held to be a branch or specie of the rule of estoppel called "estoppel byrecord". In Guda Vijayalakshmi Vs. Guda Ramchandra Sekhara Sastry, AIR 1981 SC 1143 in para 3the Apex Court observed:"Res judicata, after all, is a branch or specie of rule of estoppel called estoppel by record and thoughestoppel is often described as a rule of evidence, whole concept is more correctly viewed as asubstantive rule of law."480. A judgement operates as estoppel on all points considered and decided therein. It is thedecision and not decree that creates bar of res judicata. Res judicata, therefore, is estoppel byjudgement or record and not by decree. The judgement operates as estoppel in respect to all thefindings which are essential to sustain the judgements. What has taken place, recorded and declaredfinal, cannot be questioned subsequently by anyone which has already an opportunity to adjudicateand this is what we call as estoppel on record. The distinction between the doctrine of res judicataand estoppel would lie with the estoppel results from the acts and conduct of the parties while theres judicata prohibits the Court from entering into an inquiry as to a matter already adjudicatedupon. While in the case of estoppel it prohibits a party after the inquiry has already been enteredupon from proving anything which would contradict his own previous declaration or acts to theprejudice of another party who relying upon those declaration or acts has altered his position. Ruleof res judicata prevents the parties to a judicial determination from litigating the same question overand again even though the determination may even be demonstratedly wrong. When theproceedings have attained finality, parties are bound by the judgement and are estopped fromquestioning it. They cannot litigate again on the same cause of action nor can they litigate any issuewhich was necessary for decision in the earlier litigation. These two aspects are "cause of actionestoppel" and "issue estoppel". It is held that these two terms are of common law origin.481. The learned counsel for the parties have also addressed this Court as to what does it mean bythe words "suit"; "issue"; "directly and substantially in issue" in order to show whether the principleof res judicata would be attracted in the cases in hand or not.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/221482. To apply the doctrine of res judicata we need to understand the meaning of the word "suit" or"issue", when a matter can be said to be "directly and substantially in issue", can it be said that theparties are same or parties in the earlier suit were the parties under whom the present one areclaiming their rights i.e. litigating under the same title.483. Learned counsel for parties admitted that as per Order IV Rule 1 CPC suit is instituted byplacing a plaint and in view of Order VI pleading means plaint and written statement and whatconstitute a plaint we may look into Order VII.484. It is not disputed by the parties that the term "suit" has not been defined in CPC. Section 26says that every suit shall be instituted by presentation of a plaint or in such other manner as may beprescribed. The term "suit" was considered by the Privy Council in Hansraj Gupta and others Vs.Dehradun Mussorie Electric Tramway Company Ltd., AIR 1933 PC 63 and it was held that word"suit" ordinarily, apart from some context, must be taken to mean a civil proceeding instituted bypresentation of a plaint. To the same effect is the view expressed by the Madras High Court inVenkata Chandrayya Vs. Venkata Rama Reddy, (1899) 22 Madras 256, Raja Gopa Chettiar Vs.Hindu Religion Endowment Board, Madras, AIR 1934 Madras 103 and by Punjab and Haryana HighCourt in Union Territory of Chandigarh Vs. Sardara Singh and others, AIR 1981 (Punjab andHaryana) 354.485. However, if a suit is filed by a pauper under Order XXXIII CPC the same would commencefrom the moment the application to sue in forma pauperis is presented. (see Matuka Mistry Vs.Kamakhaya Prasad, AIR 1958 (Patna) 264 (FB), Narayana Dutt and another Vs. Smt. Molini Devi,AIR 1964 (Rajasthan) 269, Shripati Quer Vs. Malti Devi, AIR 1967 (Patna) 320). This illustration isonly for the purpose to show "any other manner as may be prescribed", contained in Section 26CPC.486. Similarly, the "issue" has also not been defined in CPC. Whartons "Law Lexicon" says that"issue" means "the point in question at the conclusion of the pleading between the contendingparties in an action, when one side affirms and the other side denies". Order XIV of the Code of CivilProcedure deals with the settlement of "issues" and determination of suit on issues of law or onissues agreed upon. Rule 1 deals with the framing of issues as follows:1. Issues arise when a material proposition of fact or law is affirmed by the one party and deemed bythe other.2. Material propositions are those propositions of law or fact which a plaintiff must allege in order toshow a right to sue or a defendant must allege in order to constitute his defence.3. Every material proposition affirmed by one party and denied by the other, shall form the subjectof a distinct issue.4. Issues are of two kinds.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/222(a)Issues of fact(b)Issues of law Meaning of "a matter directly and substantially in issue"487. Then comes as to what constitutes "a matter directly and substantially in issue". One of thetests recognized is, if the issue was necessary to be decided for adjudicating on the principle issue,and, was decided.488. A collateral or incidental issue is one i.e. ancillary to a direct and substantive issue; the formeris an auxiliary issue and the later the principal issue. The expression collateral or incidental in issueimplies that there is another matter which is directly and substantially in issue. (Mulla's C.P.C. 16thEdition, Vol. I, page 179).489. Difficulty, however, in distinguishing whether a matter was directly in issue or collaterally inissue confronted various Courts in different Countries and certain tests were laid down therein.Halsbury's Laws of England (Vol. 16, para 1538, 4th Edn.) says "difficulty arises in the application ofthe rule, in determining in each case what was the point decided and what was the matterincidentally cognizable, and the opinion of Judges seems to have undergone some fluctuations."490. In "The Doctrine of Res Judicata" (2nd Edn., 1969, p. 181), "Spencer Bower and Turner",quoted Dixon, J. of the Australian High Court in Blair Vs. Churran (1939) 62 CLR 464 at page 553;"The difficulty in the actual application of these conceptions is to distinguish the mattersfundamental or cardinal to the prior decision on judgment, or necessarily involved in it as its legaljustification or foundation, from matters which, even though actually raised and decided as being inthe circumstances of the case the determining considerations, yet are not in point of law theessential foundation of a groundwork of the judgment."491. The aforesaid authorities opined in order to understand this essential distinction, one hasalways to inquire with unrelenting severity- is the determination upon which it is sought to find anestoppel so fundamental to the substantive decision that the latter cannot stand without the former.Nothing less than this will do. It is suggested by Dixon, J. that even where this inquiry is answeredsatisfactorily, there is still another test to pass: viz. whether the determination is the "immediatefoundation" of the decision as opposed to merely "a proposition collateral or subsidiary only, i.e. notmore than part of the reasoning supporting the conclusion." It is well settled, say the above authors,"that a mere step in reasoning is insufficient. What is required is no less than the determination oflaw, or fact or both, fundamental to the substantive decision."492. Corpus Juris Secundum (Vol. 50, para 725) noticed the above aspects and conceded it issometimes difficult to determine when particular issue determined is of sufficient dignity to becovered by the rule of estoppel. It is said that estoppel by judgment does not extend to any matterwhich was only incidentally cognizable or which came collaterally in question, although it may havearisen in the case and have been judicially passed on.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/223493. However, this rule did not prevent a judgment from constituting an estoppel with reference toincidental matters necessarily adjudicated in determining ultimate vital point.494. American Jurispudence (Vol. 46, Judgments, para 422) says; "Under this rule, if the record ofthe former trial shows that the judgment could not have been rendered without deciding theparticular matter, it will be considered as having settled that matter as to all future actions betweenthe parties."495. The words "substantially" means "of importance and value". When a matter is substantially inissue, when it is of importance and value for the decision of main proceeding. When parties go to atrial on a particular issue treating it as material and invites the Court to give a decision thereon, thatwill be an issue substantially and directly involved and would operate as res judicata. However, amere expression of opinion on a question not in issue cannot operate as res judicata as held inRagho Prasad Gupta Vs. Krishna Poddar AIR 1969 SC 316.496. In Sajjadanashin Sayed Md. B.E. Edr. (D) By LRS. Vs. Musa Dadabhai Ummer and others2000 (3) SCC 350, the term "directly and substantially in issue" qua the words "incidental andcollateral" came up for consideration. The Edroos family in Gujarat claimed to be descendants ofHazarat Imam Ali, the son-in-law and cousin of Prophet Muhamed. One of the descendants of thesaid Hazrat came down to India in 1542 A.D. and founded his Gadi at Ahmedabad, Broach andSurat. The members of the Edroos family were Sajjadanashins or Mutavallis of the wakf throughout.The three Rozas at the three places as well as the villages which were granted - not only for themaintenance of these Rozas but also for the benefit of the Waquif's family, - constituted the wakf.The holder was buried in the house and his Dargah is situated in this place. There is also a place forreciting prayers. In an earlier litigation in Sayed Abdula Edrus Vs. Sayad Zain Sayad Hasan EdrusILR (1889) 13 Bom. 555, a Division Bench of the Bombay High Court, traced the history of the wakfand held that the custom of primogeniture did not apply to the office of Sajjadanishin or Mutavalliof this wakf. In a later dispute in Saiyad Jaffar El Edroos Vs. Saiyad Mahomed El Edroos AIR 1937Bom. 217 another Division Bench held after construing the royal grants relating to the villagesUmrao and Orma that the grants were primarily for the Rozas and Dargas and they clearlyconstituted "wakf" but that the Sajjadanashin or Mutavalli had, however, a right to the surplusincome left over after discharge of the legal obligations regarding the wakf. It was thus held that theSajjadanishin could provide for the needs of the indigent members of the family and this was a piousobligation which was only a moral obligation and not a legal obligation and hence the indigentmembers of the Edroos family, as a right, could not claim maintenance out of the surplus income.Thereafter, Regular Suit No. 201 of 1928 was filed by three plaintiffs under Section 92 C.P.C.impleading father of Sayed Mohamed Baquir-El-Edroos in 1928 after obtaining permission on22.2.1928 from the Collector under Section 92 C.P.C. for filing the suit. The suit was dismissed on6.10.1931, the first appeal was dismissed but cross objections were allowed on 21.11.1938 and thesecond appeal to the High Court was withdrawn. In the aforesaid suit, there were eight pointswhereof points no. 1 to 7 related to the validity of appointment of the defendant and the nature ofthe office and the right to the surplus etc. It was held that the appointment of defendant asSajjadanashin was valid and that the grant of the property was both for the Rozas and for themaintenance, presumably of the Sajjadanashin and his family members. It was also held that theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/224Sajjadanashin had complete power of disposal over the surplus as he was not in the position of anordinary trustee. It was held that the Sajjadanashin had complete power of disposal over thesurplus, hence the plea of plaintiff's complaint about mis-utilization of the income by Sajjadanashinwas rejected. Another issue was framed whether the waqf was a private or a public and it was heldthat it was a private waqf. The District Court held that from 1746 A.D. onwards, the Sajjadanashinwere using the revenue of these villages for their own maintenance and that of the members of theirfamily and other dependents. This finding was consistent with the judgment of the Bombay HighCourt in Saiyad Jaffar El Edroos (supra) wherein this was held permissible. The District Court inview of the fact that Sajjadanashin was from the family and not a stranger or outside held it a privatewaqf. Thereafter another matter came before the Gujrat High Court in relation to Ahmedabad Rozaswherein also a Single Judge of Bombay High Court in Alimiya Vs. Sayed Mohd. AIR 1968 Guj. 257rejected a similar plea. This judgment was confirmed by the Division Bench in Sayed Mohd. Vs.Alimiya (1972) 13 Guj.LR 285. In the case before the Apex Court in respect to Rozas at all the threeplaces, the Assistant Commissioner in enquiry no. 142 of 1967 passed an order dated 26.7.1968accepting the preliminary objection of res judicata but the Joint Charity Commissioner, Gujarat inits order dated 17.12.1973, in appeal, did not accept the said plea which was pressed before him onlyin respect of the Rozas at Broach and Surat. He set aside the order of Assistant Commissioner andremanded the matter for enquiry. The Assistant Judge in Misc. Civil Application No. 32 of 1974affirmed the order of Joint Commissioner on 3.9.1976 and it was further affirmed by a DivisionBench of Gujarat High Court in First Appeal No. 985 of 1976 on 27.7.1985. Aggrieved by theaforesaid order, the appellant, Sajjadanashin Sayed took the matter to the Apex Court and raised theplea of res judicata in respect of Rozas at Broach and Surat. It is in the light of the above facts, theApex Court considered the matter. In order to see whether the principle of res judicata is attracted,the Apex Court framed an issue as to what is the meaning of "collaterally and incidentally in issue"as distinguished from "directly and substantially in issue". In para 11, the Apex Court found that thematter collaterally and incidentally in issue are not ordinarily res judicata and this principle hasbeen well accepted but certain exceptions to this principle have also been accepted. The Court alsotraced out the law on the subject in England, America, Australia and India. Referring to Halsbury'sLaws of England (Vol. 16, para 1538, 4th Edn.), the Court observed that the fundamental rule is thata judgment is not conclusive if any matter came collaterally in question or if any matter isincidentally cognizable. The said judgment attained finality since the second appeal filed in the HighCourt was withdrawn.497. In the light of the above facts and in this context the Apex Court in Sajjadanashin (supra) inrespect of India, affirmed the view of the learned Author Mulla in "C.P.C." as under:"..a matter in respect of which relief is claimed in an earlier suit can be said to be generally a matter"directly and substantially" in issue but it does not mean that if the matter is one in respect of whichno relief is sought it is not directly or substantially in issue. It may or may not be. It is possible that itwas "directly and substantially" in issue and it may also be possible that it was only collaterally orincidentally in issue, depending upon the facts of the case. The question arises as to what is the testfor deciding into which category a case falls? One test is that if the issue was "necessary" to bedecided for adjudicating on the principle issue and was decided, it would have to be treated as"directly and substantially" in issue and if it is clear that the judgment was in fact based upon thatSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/225decision, then it would be res judicata in a later case. One has to examine the plaint, the writtenstatement, the issues and the judgment to find out if the matter was directly and substantially inissue (Ishwer Singh Vs. Sarwan Singh AIR 1965 SC 948 and Syed Mohd. Salie Labbai Vs. Mohd.Hanifa AIR 1976 SC 1569).498. It also referred to two judgments of the Privy Council in Run Bahadur Singh Vs. Lucho KoerILR (1885) 11 Cal 301 and Asrar Ahmed Vs. Durgah Committee AIR 1947 PC 1 as well as its earlierdecision in Pragdasji Guru Bhagwandasji Vs. Ishwarlalbhai Narsibhai 1952 SCR 513 and found thatinspite of a specific issue and adverse finding in the earlier suit, the finding was not treated as resjudicata as it was purely incidental or auxiliary or collateral to the main issue in each of the threecases and was not necessary for the earlier case nor formed foundation. It also considered SulochanaAmma (supra) and a Madras High Court decision in Vanagiri Sri Selliamman AyyanarUthirasomasundar-eswarar Temple Vs. Rajanga Asari Air 1965 Mad. 355 in respect whereto it waspointed out that there was a direct conflict. The Court however found that the said decisions are notcontrary to each other but should be understood in the context of the tests referred to above. It heldthat in Sulochana Amma (supra) it is to be assumed that the tests above referred to were satisfiedfor holding that the finding as to position was substantially rested on title upon which a finding wasfelt necessary but in the case before the Madras High Court, it must be assumed that the tests werenot satisfied. The Apex Court confirmed the observations of the learned author Mulla in "C.P.C.(Supra)" and said that it all depend on the facts of each case and whether the finding as to title wastreated as necessary for grant of an injunction in an earlier suit and was also substantive basis forgrant of injunction or not.499. Further, the Court in Sajjadanashin (supra) quoted the following from the "Corpus JurisSecundum" (Vol. 50, para 735, p. 229) where a similar aspect in regard to findings on possessionand incidental findings on title were dealt with and held, "Where title to property is the basis of theright of possession, a decision on the question of possession is res judicata on the question of title tothe extent that adjudication of title was essential to the judgment; but where the question of theright to possession was the only issue actually or necessary involved, the judgment is not conclusiveon the question of ownership or title." The Court observed that in the case before it there werecertain changes in the statutory law with respect to definition of "public waqf" and in view thereofsince now the "private waqf" was also included within the definition of "public waqf" in the Act, dueto change in subject it held that the earlier decision would not operate as res judicata.500. In Sharadchandra Ganesh Muley Vs. State of Maharashtra and others AIR 1996 SC 61,Explanation IV Section 11A containing doctrine of 'might and ought' and application of doctrine ofconstructive res judicata came to be considered. The Court held that where in respect of landacquisition proceedings an earlier writ petition was filed without raising a plea which was availableat that time, in the second writ petition such plea could not have been taken as the doctrine of 'mightand ought' engrafted in Explanation IV to Section 11 of the C.P.C. would come into play and theincumbent would be precluded from raising the controversy once over. The Court held that thedoctrine of constructive res judicata shall put an embargo on his right to raise a plea as barred bylimitation under Section 11A.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/226"Explanation IV"501. However, the concept of "constructive res judicata" is necessary to be dealt with in view ofExplanation-IV Section 11 C.P.C. A Matter, which might and ought to have been made a ground ofattack or defence is a, matter which is constructively in issue. The principle underlyingExplanation-IV is res judicata not confined to issues which the Courts are actually asked to decidebut cover issues or facts which are so clearly part of the subject matter of the litigation and so clearlycould have been raised that it would be an abuse of the process of the Court to allow a newproceeding to be started in respect of them. (State of U.P. Vs. Nawab Hussain AIR 1977 SC 1680).The proposition of law expounded in the authorities cited by Sri Siddiqui, as referred to above, inpara 20 is also unexceptional. However,it would apply only where a plea was available at the time ofthe suit but not availed of. But there is no question of constructive res judicata where there is noadjudication in the earlier proceedings (Kewal Singh Vs. Smt. Lajwanti 1980 (1) SCC 290). Theeffect of Explanation-IV is where a matter has been constructively in issue, it could not from the verynature of the case be heard and decided but will be deemed to have been heard and decided againstthe parties omitting to allege it except when an admission by the defendant obviates a decision (SriGopal Vs. Pirthi Singh (1902) ILR 24 Alld. 429 (PC); Government of Province of Bombay Vs. PestonJi Ardeshir Wadia AIR 1949 PC 143).502. There is an exception to this plea, i.e., where the evidence in support of one ground is such asmight be destructive for the other ground, the two grounds need not be set up in the same suit. InKanhiya Lal Vs. Ashraf Khan AIR 1924 Alld. 355, it was observed that a person claiming property onthe allegation that it is wakf property and that he is the Manager thereof is not bound to claim thesame property in the same suit alternatively in his own rights in the event of its being held that theproperty was not wakf property. In Madhavan Vs. Chathu AIR (38) 1951 Madras 285, a suit torecover possession of properties on a claim that they belong personally to the plaintiff was held notbarred by reason of a decision in a previous suit, in which they were claimed as belonging to aTarwad of which he was a member. Similarly, where the right claimed in the subsequent suit isdifferent from that in the former suit; it is claimed under a different form that in the former suit; itis claimed under a different title, the subsequent suit would not be barred by resjudicata/constructive res judicata.503. Next is the question about the "same parties" or "between parties under whom they or any ofthem claim". In order to find a person by res judicata it must be shown that he was in some wayparty to the earlier suit as the judgment binds only parties and privies. A person claiming under aparty is known as privy. The ground of privity is property and not personal relations. If the plaintiffin subsequent suit claims independent right over the suit property the principle of res judicatawould not apply. If the predecessor in interest was party to the suit/proceeding involving the sameproperty then the decision binds his successor in interest. From the record it must be evident thatthe party sought to be bound was in some way a party to the suit. A person merely interested in thelitigation cannot be said to be a party to the suit. Such a person is neither to make himself a partynor can be bound by the result of the litigation as held in Jujjuvarapu Vs. Pappala, AIR 1969 A.P. 76.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/227504. Where a person in the subsequent suit claims independent right over the suit property theprinciple of res judicata would not apply. (Byathaiah (Kum) and others Vs. Pentaiah (Kum) andothers, 2000 (9) SCC 191).505. Similarly the party must be litigating under the same title. The test is the identity of title in twolitigations and not the identity of the actual property involved in two cases as held in Smt. RajLakshmi Dasi and others Vs. Banamali Sen (supra); Ram Gobinda Daw Vs. Smt. H. Bhakta BalaDassi, AIR 1971 SC 664.506. Same title means same capacity; the test being whether the party litigating is in law the same ora different person. If the same person is a party in different character, the decision in the former suitdoes not operate as res judicata. Similarly, if the rights claimed are different, the subsequent suitwill not be res judicata simply because the property is identical. Title refers not to cause of action butto the interest or capacity of the party suing or being sued.507. In Sri Ramjee and others Vs. Bishwanath Pd. Sah and others AIR 1978 Patna 129, former suitwas filed by plaintiff alone and in his own rights while the subsequent suit was filed in the name ofthe deity and it was held not barred as res judicata."Explanation VI"508. Lastly, but not the least, is the concern with respect to Explanation-VI, i.e., representative suit.It provides that where persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right or a private right claimedin common for themselves and other persons interested in such right, shall, for the purpose of theSection, be deemed to have claimed under the persons so litigating. The counsel for appellant hasheavily relied upon this provision. Explanation-VI apparently is not confined to the cases covered byOrder 1 Rule 8 C.P.C., but would include any litigation in which, apart from the rule altogether,parties are entitled to represent interested persons other then themselves. It is a kind of exception tothe ordinary rule of res judicata which provide for the former litigation between the same parties ortheir privies. Even persons, who are not parties in the earlier proceeding, in certain contingencies,may be debarred from bringing a suit subsequently if the conditions contemplated underExplanation-VI Section 11 are satisfied. The conditions to attract Explanation-VI so as to constituteres judicata, which must exist, are :1. There must be a right claimed by one or more persons in common for themselves and others notexpressly named in the suit,2. The parties not expressly named in the suit must be interested in such right.3. The litigation must have been conducted bona fide on behalf of all the parties interested.4. If the suit is one under Order 1 Rule 8, all the conditions of that Section must have been strictlycomplied with.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/228509. The essentials of representative suit vis a vis the principle of res judicata with reference toExplanation VI Section 11was considered by Privy Council in Kumaravelu Chettiar and others Vs.T.P. Ramaswami Ayyar and others, AIR 1933 PC 183. Prior to the enactment of CPC of 1877 therewas no express legislation on the subject of representative suit. In these circumstances, the Courtsassumed the task and followed the practice virtually obtained in the Court of Chancery in England.Existence of this practice was demonstrated by referring to a judgment of Madras High Court inSrikanti Vs. Indupuram (1866) 3 M.H.C.R. 226. The Court emphasized that convenience, wherecommunity of interest existed, required that a few out of a large number of persons should, underproper conditions, be allowed to represent the whole body, so that in the result all might be boundby the decree, although only some of the persons concerned were parties named in the record. Itobserved that absence of any statutory provision on the subject, the Courts in India, it would seem,prior to 1877 assumed the task and duty to determine in the particular case whether, without anyreal injustice to the plaintiffs in the later suit, the decree in the first could properly be regarded as anestoppel against further prosecution by them of the same claim. The first legislation was made videSection 30 in CPC 1877 which is now found in Order I Rule 8 CPC of 1908. The Privy Council held atpage 186:"It is an enabling rule of convenience prescribing the conditions upon which such persons when notmade parties to a suit may still be bound by the proceedings therein. For the section to apply theabsent persons must be numerous; they must have the same interest in the suit which, so far as it isrepresentative, must be brought or prosecuted with the permission of the Court. On such permissionbeing given it becomes the imperative duty of the Court to direct notice to be given to the absentparties in such of the ways prescribed as the Court in each case may require; while liberty is reservedto any represented person to apply to be made a party to the suit."510. The Privy Council also approved a Calcutta High Court decision in Baiju Lal Vs. Bulak Lal,(1897) 24 Cal 385, where Ameer Ali, J. explaining the position under Section 30 said:"The effect of S. 30 is that unless such permission is obtained by the person suing or defending thesuit, his action has no binding effect on the persons he chooses to represent. If the course prescribedby S. 30 is not followed in the first case, the judgment does not bind those whose names are not onthe record."511. In Waqf Khudawand Taala Banam Masjid Mauza Chaul Shahabudinpur vs. Seth Mohan Lal1956 ALJ 225 a suit for declaration of the property in dispute as a public mosque was filed. Itappears that earlier a suit was filed against some Muslims claiming to be the proprietor and noticeunder Order 1 Rule 8 C.P.C. was also issued to other residents of that locality. Defence taken byMuslims was that property in dispute was a public mosque. The suit was decreed and the defencewas not found proved. Thereafter second suit was filed by Muslim parties of neighbouring villagewherein the plea of res judicata was taken. Defending the said objection on behalf of plaintiffs it wascontended that in earlier case notice under Order 1 Rule 8 was issued to the residents of ChaulShahabuddinpur and not of the village to which the plaintiffs belonged which is a neighbouringvillage. However, the Court upholding the plea of res judicata observed that Explanation VI toSection 11 C.P.C. is attracted in the matter and once in respect of a public right the matter has beenSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/229adjudicated, the decision is binding on all persons interested in that right and they will be deemed toclaim under the persons who litigated in the earlier suit in respect of that public right.512. The question of issue estoppel and constructive res judicata in regard to a judgment in arepresentative suit came to be considered by the Apex Court in Shiromani Gurdwara ParbandhakCommittee Vs. Mahant Harnam Singh and others, AIR 2003 SC 3349. The facts, in brief, arenecessary to understand the exposition of law laid down therein. Gurdial Singh and Ishwar Singh ofVillage Jhandawala obtained permission from the Advocate General under Section 92 CPC toinstitute a suit against one Harnam Singh for his removal from Mahantship. It was stated in theplaint that there was one Guru Granth Sahib at Village Jhandawala, Tehsil and District Bhatindawhich was managed by Mahant Harnam Singh as a Mahatmim and he was in possession of theDera, and agricultural land belonging to Guru Granth Sahib which was a public religious place andwas established by the residents of village; it was a public trust created by the residents of the villagefor the service of the public to provide food from lunger, to allow the people to fulfill religious beliefsand for worship etc. The two plaintiffs in their capacity as representatives of owners of land situatedin the village and the residents thereof claim that they were entitled to file a suit under Section 92CPC. Harnam Singh, Mahant in his written statement took the defence that there was no suchinterest in the public as to entitle the aforesaid plaintiffs to institute the suit. The trial Court and theHigh Court recorded a concurrent finding that all Mahants of the institution from Bhai Saida Ramto Mahant Harnam Singh have been Nirmalas. However, the trial Court held that such NirmalaSadhus are not Sikhs and that the institution was not a Sikh institution. High Court disagreed withthis conclusion and held that Sadhus Nirmalas are a sect of the Sikhs and consequently the Sikhshad interest in the institution as it was a Sikh Gurdwara and upheld the plaintiffs claim to file arepresentative suit under Section 92 CPC. In appeal the Apex Court, however, held (i) NirmalaSadhus are not Sikhs; (ii) the mere fact that at some stage there was a Guru Granth Sahib in theDera in dispute cannot lead to any conclusion that the institution was meant for or belonged to thefollowers of the Sikh religion. The Dera was maintained for entirely a distinct sect known as NirmalsSadhus who cannot be regarded as Sikhs; (iii) the institution was held to be not belonging to thefollowers of the Sikh religion; (iv) the plaintiffs in their mere capacity of followers of Sikh religioncould not be held to have such interest as to entitle them to institute a suit under Section 92 CPC.This judgement dated 24.02.1967 of the Apex Court is reported as Mahant Harnam Singh Vs.Gurdial Singh and another, AIR 1967 SC 1415. In the meantime it appears that under Section 7(1) ofSikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925, 60 persons claiming to be worshippers made a petition for declaring theinstitution in question, i.e., Guru Granth Sahib situated in Village Jhandawala, District Bhatinda tobe a Sikh Gurdwara. The Punjab Government by notification dated 23.01.1961 made such adeclaration under Section 7(3) of the aforesaid Act. It may be pointed out that these 60 persons alsoincluded the two plaintiffs of earlier litigation, i.e., Gurdial Singh and Ishwar Singh. MahantHarnam Singh with others filed counter petition under Section 8 of Sikh Gurdwaras Act, 1925stating that the institution was not a Sikh Gurdwara but was a Dera Bhai Saida Ram. A similarpetition under Section 8 was also moved by 58 persons of the Dera making a similar claim. Boththese petitions were forwarded by the State Government to the Tribunal for disposal. The Tribunalformulated the following two questions: (1) what is the effect of the judgment of the Apex Court inMahant Harnam Singh (supra); and (2) whether the institution in dispute was a Sikh Gurdwara. TheTribunal decided issue no. 1 as a preliminary issue vide order dated 08.03.1977 and held that theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/230decision in Mahant Harnam Singh (supra) would not bar the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to decideclaim petition under Section 7 of the Act. The order of the Tribunal attained finality since challengebefore the High Court and Apex Court was unsuccessful. Thereafter, issue no. 2 was taken up andthe Tribunal held that the institution was a Sikh Gurdwara, originally established by Sikhs and theobject of worship was Guru Granth Sahib because the majority of villagers were Sikhs and Nirmalasare Sikhs. This order of the Tribunal in respect of issue no. 2 was challenged before the High Court.It held that the Tribunal had lost sight of the decision in Mahant Harnam Singh (supra). It is thisorder of the High Court which was taken in appeal before the Apex Court, which held that once in asuit instituted under Section 92 CPC a categorical finding was recorded that (i) Nirmala Sadhus arenot Sikhs; (ii) the Dera was maintained for entirely a distinct sect known as Nirmals Sadhus whocannot be regarded as Sikhs; (iii) the mere fact that at some stage there was a Guru Granth Sahib inthe Dera cannot lead to any conclusion that the institution was meant for or belonged to thefollowers of Sikh religion, these findings were rendered in suit filed under Section 92 CPC, therefore,cannot be reagitated and any challenge thereto is precluded on the principle of issue estoppel. Thenature of suit under Section 92 CPC was explained by the Apex Court in para 19 of the judgementreferring to its earlier decision in R. Venugopala Naidu and others Vs. Venkatarayulu NaiduCharities and others, AIR 1990 SC 444 holding that a suit under Section 92 CPC is a suit of specialnature for the protection of public rights in the public trust and charities. The suit is fundamentallyon behalf of the entire body of persons who are interested in the trust. It is for vindication of publicrights. The beneficiaries of the trust, which may consist of public at large, may choose two or morepersons amongst themselves, for the purpose of filing a suit under Section 92 CPC and the suit-titlein that event would show only their names as plaintiffs. In the circumstances, it cannot be said thatthe parties to the suit are only those persons whose names are mentioned in the suit-title. Thenamed plaintiffs being the representatives of public at large, which is interested in the trust, of suchinterested persons, would be considered in the eyes of law to be parties to the suit. A suit underSection 92 CPC is thus a representative suit and as such binds not only the parties named in thesuit-title but all those who share common interest and are interested in the trust. It is for that reasonthat Explanation 6 to Section 11 CPC constructively bars by res judicata the entire body of interestedpersons from reagitating the matter directly and substantially in issue in an earlier suit underSection 92 CPC.513. It is well settled law that explanation to a Section is not a substantive provision by itself. It isentitled to explain the meaning of the words contained in the Section or to clarify certainambiguities or clear them up. It becomes a part and parcel of the enactment. Its meaning mustdepend upon its terms. Sometimes, it is for exclusion of some thing and sometimes excludessomething from the ambit of the main provision or condition of some words existing therein.Therefore, an explanation should be read harmoniously so as to clear any ambiguity in the mainsection. A clash of interest in the parties would oust the applicability of Explanation-VI.514. In Commissioner of Endowments and others Vs. Vittal Rao and others (2005) 4 SCC 120, it washeld that even though an issue was not formerly framed but if it was material and essential for thedecision of the case in the earlier proceedings and the issue has been decided, it shall operate as resjudicata in the subsequent case.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/231515. In Vithal Yeshwant Jathar Vs. Shikandarkhan Makhtumkhan Sardesai AIR 1963 SC 385, it washeld :"It is well settled that if the final decision in any matter at issue between the parties is based by aCourt on its decisions on more than one point- each of which by itself would be sufficient for theultimate decision- the decision on each of these points operates as res judicata between the parties."516. These are the few general principles, which we have considered and elaborated to find answerto the issues relating to res judicata and estoppal raised by learned counsels for the parties.517. In Madhukar D. Shende Vs. Tarabai Aba Shedage, 2002(2) SCC 85 plaintiff who has lost in allthe three Courts below took appeal in Supreme Court. A suit for declaration of title and preventiveinjunction and in alternative for recovery of possession was dismissed by Trial Court and secondappeal was dismissed by High Court. Plaintiff set up the case in respect of disputed property whichwas admittedly owned by late Bhagubai, who expired on 24.09.1963. Before death of Bhagubai, asclaimed by plaintiff, he executed a registered deed of Will on 22.09.1963 in favour of Chingubai,sister of Bhagubai. Chingubai by registered sale deed dated 24.09.1976 transferred property toplaintiff. Courts below held that Will was not proved due to suspicious circumstances and plaintifffailed to prove its title over disputed land hence dismissed same. Before Supreme Courtdefendant-respondent admitted that there was no proof of title of defendant over suit property. Italso gave up its plea of acquisition of title by adverse possession. It was also not disputed thatdisputed property vested in Bhagubai and sale deed executed by Chingubai in favour of plaintiff wasalso proved. Therefore, dispute was only with regard to Will which the Courts below held not proveddue to suspicious circumstances and that was the issue considered by Supreme Court. Courtobserved that requirement of proof of a Will is the same as any other document excepting thatevidence tendered in proof of a will should additionally satisfy requirement of Section 63 of theIndian Succession Act, 1925 and Section 68 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Law of evidence doesnot permit conjecture or suspicion having the place of legal proof nor permits them to demolish afact otherwise proved by legal and convincing evidence. Well founded suspicion may be a ground forcloser scrutiny of evidence but suspicion alone cannot form foundation of a judicial verdict positiveor negative. One who propounds a Will must establish competence of testator to make Will at thetime when it was executed. The factors, such as, Will being a natural one or being registered orexecuted in such circumstances and ambience, as would leave no room for suspicion, assumesignificance. Who are the persons propounding and supporting a Will as against the persondisputing Will and pleadings of parties would be relevant and of significance. In this regard Courtfound that relevant piece of evidence, i.e., an earlier judgment was not considered by Courts belowinasmuch as one of the property (not subject matter of suit) was earlier pleaded to a dispute betweensame parties. Said property was under tenancy of Tarabai as a tenant of Bhagubai and suit propertywas trespassed upon by Tarabai. With regard to tenanted premises Chingubai filed a suit forejectment against Tarabai after terminating his tenancy and claiming right to sue by virtue of sameWill dated 22.09.1963. Tarabai in said suit had denied Will. Trial Court dismissed suit. FirstAppellate Court allowed appeal observing that Will was challenged by a mere tenant having nointerest in property except by adverse possession, evidence which was tendered, adequate to provetestamentary capacity as well as the execution of the Will. Judgment of First Appellate Court wasSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/232upheld by High Court by dismissing writ petition filed by Tarabai under Article 227 of theConstitution upholding the findings of Lower Appellate Court on the Will to be duly attested andregistered document executed by Bhagubai.518. Before Supreme Court plaintiff's counsel sought to plead the aforesaid findings in earlierproceeding as res judicata but the Court found that neither plea of res judicata was taken in Courtsbelow nor there was any such issue. Court found that res judicata is a mixed question of fact and lawand in absence of any such plea taken before Courts below, it cannot be permitted to be raisedbefore highest Court for the first time. However, Court finds that still the judgment of earlierlitigation between same parties was a relevant piece of evidence under Sections 11, 13 and 35 ofEvidence Act having material bearing on the controversy arising for decision in subsequent suit.This material aspect was completely overlooked by all the three Courts and this was a serious errorof law having consequence on the findings on most vital issue on the said case. Court also found thatalleged suspicious circumstances were all untenable and constitute irrelevant consideration tonegative the otherwise well admissible proof to establish the Will. It observed:"Courts below have allowed their findings to be influenced by such suspicion and conjectures ashave no foundation in the evidence and have no relevance in the facts and circumstances of the caseand unwittingly allowed their process of judicial thinking to be vitiated by irrelevant reasonings andconsiderations. The weighty factor that the factum of execution of will by Bhagubai was beingdenied by a rank trespasser without raising any specific pleadings and the fact that no relation ofBhagubai has chosen to lay a challenge to the will, have been simply overlooked. In our opinion, theHigh Court ought not to have sustained such a perverse finding which would result in the propertyof a rightful owner being lost to a trespasser."519. This judgment, in our view, does not help parties on the issue of res judicata since it has beendecided on the ground that relevant piece of evidence, i.e., judgment of Court rendered in respect ofa property between same party relating to same document of Will was not considered by Courtswhile recording a contrary finding in respect of same document, i.e., 'Will'.520. One of the decisions relied by learned counsel for appellant relating to religious endowment isDr. Subramanian Swamy vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others, 2014(5) SCC 75. It relates to SriSabhanayagar Temple at Chidambaram. Temple was in existence since time immemorial. It wasbeing administered by Podhu Dikshitars, all male married members of the families of SmarthiBrahmins who claim to have been called for the establishment of the Temple in the name of LordNatraja. In 1927 Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act, 1927 was enacted byState of Madras, which was repealed by Madras Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Act,1951 (hereinafter referred to as the "MHRCE Act, 1951"). Pursuant to MHRCE Act, 1951 Governmentpromulgated scheme for management of Temple by constituting Hindu Religious EndowmentsBoard, Madras, which appointed an Executive Officer for the management of the Temple vide orderdated 28.08.1951. This order dated 28.08.1951 was challenged by Dikshitars before High Court in awrit petition which was allowed vide judgment dated 13.12.1951 and said order was quashed.Holding that the Dikshitars constituted a 'religious denomination' and their position vis-Ã -vis theTemple was analogous to Muttadhipati/Mutt, hence the order passed by Board was violative ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/233Article 26 of the Constitution. State of Madras's appeal was dismissed by Supreme Court on09.02.1954 whereupon notification was withdrawn by State Government. Subsequently, MHRCEAct, 1951 was repleaded by Tamil Nadu Religious and Charitable Endowment Act, 1959 (hereinafterreferred to as the "TNRCE Act, 1959") and therein also statutory authorities were empowered toappoint Administrative Officer to administer the religious institutions. However certain safeguardswere provided under various provisions including Section 107 of TNRCE Act, 1959. Commissioner,Religious Endowments on 31.07.1987 appointed an Executive Officer and on 05.08.1987 passed anorder defining duties and powers of Executive Officer appointed for administration of temple. Theseorders were again challenged in writ petition before High Court which was dismissed vide judgmentdated 17.02.1997. An intra-Court appeal was preferred by Dikshitars which was disposed of videorder dated 01.11.2004 giving liberty to Dikshitars to file a revision before Government underSection 114 of TNRCE Act, 1959 since writ petition was filed without exhausting statutory remedy.Consequently, revision was filed but dismissed on 09.05.2006. This revisional order was challengedin writ petition which was also dismissed vide judgment dated 02.02.2009 holding that finding thatDikshitars were religious denomination hold in Marimuthu Dikshitar v. The State of Madras andAnr., 1952(1) MLJ 557 would not operate as res judicata. The writ appeal preferred by Dikshitarswherein Dr. Subramanian Swamy was also allowed to be a party was dismissed vide judgment dated15.09.2009, hence matter went to Supreme Court in aforesaid case.521. It was argued that a declaration made by Court in a list between Dikshitars, State and ReligiousEndowment Commissioner acknowledging them as religious denomination would operate as resjudicate and the High Court could not have taken an otherwise view in a subsequent litigation. Itwas also argued that under TNRCE Act, 1959 State may have a power to regulate activities of templebut lack competent to direct Dikshitars from their right to manage and administer the Temple andits property.522. The issue was contested on the ground that Article 26(d) applies only when temple/property isowned and established by 'religious denomination', which was not the case so far as Dikshitars areconcerned and, therefore, earlier judgment will not operate as res judicata. After examiningprovisions of TNRCE Act, 1959 Court observed that it did not contemplate supersession ofadministration in perpetuity but it provides a temporary measure till the evil gets remedied. Courtalso explained the meaning of expression "religious denomination" by referring to its earlierdecision in Commissioner, Hindu Religious Endowments, Madras v. Sri Lakshmindra TirthaSwamiar of Sri Shirur Mutt, AIR 1954 SC 282 that word "denomination" as per Oxford Dictionarymeans, "a collection of individuals classed together under the same name: a religious sect or bodyhaving a common faith and organisation and designated by a distinctive name". Court observed thatpractice of setting up Maths as centres of theological teaching was started by Shri Sankaracharyaand was followed by various teachers since then. After Sankara, came a galaxy of religious teachersand philosophers who founded the different sects and sub sects of the Hindu religion that we find inIndia at the present day. Each one of such sects or sub-sects can certainly be called a religiousdenomination, as it is designated by a distinctive name, in many cases in the name of the founderand has a common faith and common spiritual organization. Court also held that the issue, whetherDikshitars constitute a 'religious denomination' and whether they have a right to participate inadministration of Temple, both stood finalized by High Court in the earlier judgment i.e. MarimuthuSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/234Dikshitar (Supra) and, thus, doctrine of res judicata is applicable in full force.523. On the question of res judicata Court formulated question, whether an issue in a case betweensame parties, which had been finally determined could be negated relying upon interpretation of lawgiven subsequently in some other cases. It answered the said question in negative. Court stressedupon the fact that when an issue between same parties have already been settled in earlier lis, itmust be treated to have come to an end and should not be allowed to be reagitated in subsequentproceedings. In this context it explained the meaning of 'res' stating:"The literal meaning of "res" is "everything that may form an object of rights and includes an object,subject-matter or status" and "res judicata" literally means "a matter adjudged a thing judiciallyacted upon or decided: a thing or matter settled by judgments". "Res judicata pro veritate accipiter"is the full maxim which has, over the years, shrunk to mere "res judicata", which means that resjudicata is accepted for truth. The doctrine contains the rule of conclusiveness of the judgmentwhich is based partly on the maxim of Roman jurisprudence "interest reipublicae ut sit finislithium" (it concerns the State that there be an end to law suits) and partly on the maxim "nemodebet bis vexari pro uno et eadem causa" (no man should be vexed twice over for the same cause)."524. Referring earlier decisions, in Dr. Subramanian Swamy vs. State of Tamil Nadu (supra) Courtalso said:(1) Even an erroneous decision on a question of law attracts the doctrine of res judicata between theparties to it. The correctness or otherwise of a judicial decision has no bearing upon the questionwhether or not it operates as res judicata. (Vide: Shah Shivraj Gopalji v. Edappakath Ayissa Bi andOrs., AIR 1949 PC 302; and Mohanlal Goenka v. Benoy Kishna Mukherjee and Ors. AIR 1953 SC65).(2) A different view on interpretation of law may be possible but the same should not be accepted incase it has the effect of unsettling transactions which had been entered into on the basis of thosedecisions, as reopening past and closed transactions or settled titles all over would standjeopardized and this would create a chaotic situation which may bring instability in the society.(3) Declaration that "Dikshitars are religious denomination or section thereof" is in fact adeclaration of their status and making such declaration is in fact a judgment in rem.525. In Smt. Raj Lakshmi Dasi and Ors. v. Banamali Sen and Ors., AIR 1953 SC 33 in para 15 Courtsaid:"15. .....the rule of res judicata, while founded on ancient precedents, is dictated by a wisdom whichis for all time..... Though the rule of the Code may be traced to an English source, it embodies adoctrine in no way opposed to the spirit of the law as expounded by the Hindu commentators.Vijnanesvara and Nilakantha include the plea of a former judgment among those allowed by law,each citing for this purpose the text of Katyayana, who describes the plea thus: 'If a person thoughdefeated at law, sue again, he should be answered, "you were defeated formerly". This is called theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/235plea of former judgment" .... And so the application of the rule by the Courts in India should beinfluenced by no technical considerations of form, but by matter of substance within the limitsallowed by law."526. In Satyadhyan Ghosal Vs. Deorajin Debi, AIR 1960 SC 941 scope of principle of res judicata wasexplained as under:"7. The principle of res judicata is based on the need of giving a finality to judicial decisions. What itsays is that once a res is judicata, it shall not be adjudged again. Primarily it applies as between pastlitigation and future litigation. When a matter whether on a question of fact or a question of law hasbeen decided between two parties in one suit or proceeding and the decision is final, either becauseno appeal was taken to a higher Court or because the appeal was dismissed, or no appeal lies,neither party will be allowed in a future suit or proceeding between the same parties to canvass thematter again. This principle of res judicata is embodied in relation to suits in Section 11 of the Codeof Civil Procedure; but even where Section 11 does not apply, the principle of res judicata has beenapplied by Courts for the purpose of achieving finality in litigation. The result of this is that theoriginal Court as well as any higher Court must in any future litigation proceed on the basis that theprevious decision was correct."527. The above observations have been followed in Daryao Vs. State of U.P, AIR 1961 SC 1457;Greater Cochin Development Authority Vs. Leelamma Valson, 2002(2) SCC 573; and, Bhanu KumarJain Vs. Archana Kumar, 2005(1) SCC 787.528. A Constitution Bench of Supreme Court applied the doctrine of res judicata in writ jurisdictionalso in Amalgamated Coalfields Ltd. Vs. Janapada Sabha Chhindwara, AIR 1964 SC 1013 and said:"17. .... Therefore, there can be no doubt that the general principle of res judicata applies to writpetitions filed under Article 32 or Article 226. It is necessary to emphasize that the application of thedoctrine of res judicata to the petitions filed under Article 32 does not in any way impair or affectthe content of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens of India. It only seeks to regulatethe manner in which the said rights could be successfully asserted and vindicated in Courts of law."529. In Hope Plantations Ltd. (supra) Court in paras 17 and 26 said as under:"17. ..... One important consideration of public policy is that the decision pronounced by Courts ofcompetent jurisdiction should be final, unless they are modified or reversed by the appellateauthority and other principle that no one should be made to face the same kind of litigation twiceever because such a procedure should be contrary to consideration of fair play and justice."26. .... Rule of res judicata prevents the parties to a judicial determination from litigating the samequestion over again even though the determination may even be demonstratedly wrong. When theproceedings have attained finality, parties are bound by the judgment and are estopped fromquestioning it."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/236530. In Gulabchhand Chhotalal Parikh vs. State of Gujarat, AIR 1965 SC 1153 Court said thatprovisions of Section 11 CPC are not exhaustive with respect to all earlier decision operating as resjudicata between same parties on same matter in controversy in a subsequent regular suit, and onthe general principle of res judicata, any previous decision on a matter in controversy, decided afterfull contest or after affording fair opportunity to the parties to prove their case by a Court competentto decide it, will operate as res judicata in a subsequent regular suit. It is not necessary that theCourt deciding matter formerly be competent to decide subsequent suit or that former proceedingand the subsequent suit have same subject matter.531. In Erach Boman Khavar Vs. Tukaram Shridhar Bhat and another, 2013(15) SCC 655 questionup for consideration was, whether principle of res judicata would attract at successive stages of samelitigation and if so in what circumstances.532. Father of Erach Boman Khavar entered into an agreement of leave and licence with M/s PoyshaIndustrial Co. Ltd. in respect of a flat owned by him. Period of licence expired but M/s PoyshaIndustrial Co. Ltd. continued to pay licence fee and same was accepted by father of Erach BomanKhavar without prejudice. In 1990 a suit for eviction was instituted against Company andsub-tenant under Bombay Rent Act, 1947. On 04.03.1997 the sub-tenant, i.e., Tukaram ShridharBhat filed application seeking impleadment contending that he is a sub-tenant. He was also in factManaging Director of Company. Impleadment application was allowed by Small Cause Court andTukaram Shridhar Bhat was allowed to be impleaded as defendant. When suit was pending in aseparate proceeding before Company Judge in a winding up matter on 09.01.1998, a winding uporder was passed against Company. Landlord filed application before Company Judge seekingpossession of flat. On 14.02.2000 Company Judge rejected said application expressing its opinionthat before premises could be returned, rights of person to occupy the premises are required to bedetermined. It also observed that there is no legal or valid subsisting tenancy or sub-tenancy thatthe premises could be returned to landlord. This order of Company Judge dated 14.02.2000 waschallenged before Division Bench but appeal was dismissed on 22.08.2000. Thereafter father ofErach Boman Khavar filed an amendment application in plaint for incorporating certain groundsincluding unlawful subletting by Company to Tukaram Shridhar Bhat. This application was rejectedvide order dated 09.11.2000 on the ground that Bombay Rent Act, 1947 have been repealed on31.03.2000. Thereafter landlord filed Suit No. 226/336 of 2001 in Small Cause Court for eviction onthe ground of illegal subletting. Said suit was filed after obtaining leave from Company Judge. On02.01.2002 original plaintiff, i.e., father of Erach Boman Khavar died and thereafter legalrepresentative, i.e., appellant was brought on record. Suit was ultimately dismissed as withdrawn on12.07.2004. On 21.09.2005 appellant, i.e., Erach Boman Khavar terminated tenancy and on18.10.2005 filed an application before Company Judge under Section 446 of Companies Act, 1956seeking permission to file eviction suit in Small Cause Court as the respondent-Company was notentitled to protection under Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999. Company Judge grantedpermission for filing of amendment but no such amendment was filed. On 27.07.2006 CompanyJudge allowed application in terms of prayer clause (a) without prejudice to rights and contentionsof official liquidator to raise objections as permissible in law. Thereafter an application for recall wasfiled observing that Court was misled as if suit had already been instituted though no such suit wasinstituted. The application was rejected by Company Judge. This order was challenged beforeSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/237Division Bench, which allowed appeal and set aside orders dated 27.07.2006 and 28.09.2006passed by Company Judge and matter was remitted to Company Judge. Again Company Judgegranted leave. The Division Bench allowed appeal holding that second application for leave was notmaintainable and barred by principle of res judicata being a successive application in the sameCourt on self-same facts. This order of Division Bench was taken in appeal before Supreme Court.Supreme Court first examined the matter on merits and found that grant of leave of Court was not acondition precedent for initiation of civil or legal proceedings. It could have been obtained even afterinitiation of proceedings. Secondly suit property was not property of Company and so it was not acase where the Company was to face deprivation of its right and claims are to be adjudicated byCompany Judge. Company Judge was already apprised of said fact when application was filed.Coming to the question of res judicata Court reaffirmed the principle that between two stages insame litigation when a Court at earlier stage decided matter in one way, will not allow the parties toreagitate the same at the subsequent stage of the suit. Court relied on a three Judge Bench decisionin Satyadhyan Ghosal Vs. Deorajin Debi (supra).533. This principle however was subsequently explained in Arjun Singh Vs. Mohindra Kumar, AIR1964 SC 993 and in para 11 the Court said:"11. We agree that generally speaking these propositions are not open to objection. If the Courtwhich rendered the first decision was competent to entertain the suit or other proceeding, and hadtherefore competency to decide the issue or matter, the circumstance that it is a tribunal of exclusivejurisdiction or one from whose decision no appeal lay would not by themselves negative the findingon the issue by it being res judicata in later proceedings. Similarly, as stated already, though Section11 of the Civil Procedure Code clearly contemplates the existence of two suits and the findings in thefirst being res judicata in the later suit, it is well established that the principle underlying it isequally applicable to the case of decisions rendered at successive stages of the same suit orproceeding. But where the principle of res judicata is invoked in the case of the different stages ofproceedings in the same suit, the nature of the proceedings, the scope of the enquiry which theadjectival law provides for the decision being reached, as well as the specific provisions made onmatters touching such decision are some of the material and relevant factors to be considered beforethe principle is held applicable."534. Further in Arjun Singh Vs. Mohindra Kumar (supra) Court said that there are different kinds ofinterlocutory orders; some like orders of stay, injunction or Receiver are designed to preserve thestatus quo pending the litigation and to ensure that parties might not be prejudiced by normal delaywhich the proceedings before Court usually take. They do not, in that sense, decide in any mannermerits of controversy in issue in suit and do not, of course, put an end to it even in part. Such ordersare certainly capable of being altered or varied by subsequent applications for same relief, thoughnormally only on proof of new facts or new situations which subsequently emerge. As they do notimpinge upon legal rights of parties to litigation the principle of res judicata does not apply tofindings on which these orders are based, though if applications were made for relief on the samebasis after the same has once been disposed of, Court would be justified in rejecting same as anabuse of process of Court. There are other orders which are also interlocutory, but would fall into adifferent category. These are not directed to preserve property pending the final adjudication, butSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/238are designed to ensure just, smooth, orderly and expeditious disposal of suit. They are interlocutoryin the sense that they do not decide any matter in issue arising in the suit, nor put an end to thelitigation.535. In Erach Boman Khavar (supra) Court examining aforesaid aspect in para 39 of judgment said:"39. From the aforesaid authorities it is clear as crystal that to attract the doctrine of res judicata itmust be manifest that there has been conscious adjudication of an issue. A plea of res judicatacannot be taken aid of unless there is an expression of an opinion on the merits. It is well settled inlaw that principle of res judicata is applicable between the two stages of the same litigation but thequestion or issue involved must have been decided at earlier stage of the same litigation."536. The well established principle discussed in above judgements, however, in our view would haveno application to present case and could not help appellant at all.537. In Dadu Dayal Mahasabha, Jaipur (Trust) Vs. Mahant Ram Niwas and another, 2008(11) SCC753 principle of res judicata and Order 2 Rule 2 CPC were sought to be applied having regard to anobservation made by Supreme Court in a judgement. Appellant-Dadu Dayalu Mahasabha was apublic trust registered under the Rajastha Public Trusts Act, 1959 (hereinafter referred to as the"RPT Act, 1959"). Acquisition of Gaddi and Managment of said trust became a subject matter ofdispute in suit. Mahant Mani Ram Swami was holder of said Gaddi. Mahant Ram Niwas claiminghimself to be the Pota Chela of Mahant Mani Ram Swami, claimed his right to Gaddi andManagement. Suit No. 295/2 of 1964 was filed by Mahant Ram Niswas in the Court of SeniorSub-Judge, Rohtak. Another Suit No. 46 of 1967 was filed by Mahant Mani Ram Sadhu DaduPanthi. On both suits permanent injunction was prayed. Trial Court dismissed suit of Mahant RamNiwas answering following issues against him:"1. Whether the plaintiff is the Chela of Lahar Dass and Pota Chela of Mahant Mani Ram?2. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to succeed to Mahant Nitya Nand according to the custom andlaw as application to the succession of Nitya Nand as Mahant and owner of property?3. Whether Nitya Nand made a valid will in favour of defendant No.1? If so, to what effect?4. Whether the suit lies in the present form?5-A. Whether defendant No.3 or defendant No.4 was the Chela of the late Mahant Mani Ram and isnow the present Mahant of the institution?"538. Appeal was dismissed by Additional Judge Judge, Rohtak though it reversed the finding ofTrial Court in regard to Issue-4. Second appeal preferred before High Court was allowed bypermitting production of register as additional evidence and reversing findings of Trial Court onIssue-1. Appeal preferred before Supreme Court was allowed vide order dated 02.02.1987 and orderpassed in appeal reads as under:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/239"Special leave granted. The appeal is heard.Since the High Court has not and could not have in the circumstances of the case reversed thefinding of the trial Court and the First Appellate Court that the plaintiff was not in possession of thesuit property on the date of the filing of suit, it could not have reversed the decree passed by theFirst Appellate Court and made a decree for injunction for which suit has been brought. We,therefore, set aside the judgment and decree of the High Court and restore the judgment and decreeof the First Appellate Court. This judgment will not come in the way of the plaintiff/respondentfiling a suit for possession, if he is so advised."539. In view of observations made by Supreme Court that there will be no restraint in the way ofrespondent-plaintiff in filing a suit for possession, second round of litigation commenced. MahantRam Niwas filed a fresh suit in which he included as second plaintiff-Gaddi Dadu Dawara Kalanaurthrough himself. Trial Court held second suit barred by principle of res judicata holding that issuesarising therein being directly and substantially, between same parties in the previous suit, hencebarred by principle of res judicata. First Appellate Court reversed the judgment of Trial Courtholding that neither principle of res judicata nor Order 2 Rule 2 are attracted. High Court alsodismissed appeal hence defendant preferred appeal before Supreme Court. In this backdropSupreme Court in Dadu Dayal Mahasabha, Jaipur (supra) said in paras 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26,27, 28, 32, 34, 35, 42 and 43 held as under:"19. A suit is filed on a cause of action. What would constitute a cause of action is now well settled. Itwould mean a bundle of facts which would be necessary to be proved by the plaintiff so as to enablehim to obtain a decree. First Respondent's suit for possession was premised on a legal entitlement.Appellant herein also claimed its right over the Gaddi in question. The trial Court framed severalissues. Its discussion centred round the respective pleas of the parties which had fully been goneinto. The suit was dismissed. The first appellate Court not only went into the question of possessionof the first respondent over the Gaddi, as on the date of institution of the suit, but the otherquestions.20. Rightly or wrongly a decision was arrived at that the first respondent was held to be not entitledto hold the Gaddi and management of the same. A legal right of the appellant with regard theretowas found favour with the first appellate Court. On the aforementioned backdrop the implication ofthe observations of this Court must be noticed and considered.21. The order of this Court is in four parts, i.e. -i) The High Court could not have reversed the finding of the first appellate Court that the plaintiffwas not in possession of the suit property on the date of the filing of the suit.ii) In view of the said finding a decree for injunction for which the suit was filed could not have beengranted.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/240iii) The judgment and decree of the first appellate Court shall be restored after setting aside thejudgment and decree of the High Court.iv) The said judgment would not come in the way of the plaintiff/respondent in filing a suit forpossession, if he so is so advised.22. The judgment of a Court, it is trite, should not be interpreted as a statute. The meaning of thewords used in a judgment must be found out on the backdrop of the fact of each case. The Courtwhile passing a judgment cannot take away the right of the successful party indirectly which itcannot do directly. An observation made by a superior Court is not binding. What would be bindingis the ratio of the decision. Such a decision must be arrived at upon entering into the merit of theissues involved in the case.23. If the judgment and order of the first appellate Court dated 2nd January, 1973 was restored bythis Court in its order dated 2nd February, 1987, the finding arrived at by it attained finality. Theissues determined therein would be, thus, binding on the parties.24. Section 11 of the Code not only recognizes the general principle of res judicata, it bars thejurisdiction of the Court in terms of Section 12 thereof.25. Explanation IV of Section 11 of the Code extends the principle of res judicata stating that thereliefs which could have been or ought to have prayed for even if it was not prayed for would operateas res judicata. Section 12 thereof bars filing of such suit at the instance of a person who is found tobe otherwise bound by the decision in the earlier round of litigation and in a case where theprinciple of res judicata shall apply.26. We, however, are not unmindful of the principles of estoppel, waiver and res judicata, areprocedural in nature and, thus, the same will have no application in a case where judgment has beenrendered wholly without jurisdiction or issues involve only pure questions of law. Even in suchcases, the principle of issue estoppel will have no role to play.27. However, once it is held that the issues which arise in the subsequent suit were directly andsubstantial in issue in the earlier suit, indisputably Section 11 of the Code would apply.28. Similarly the provisions of Order II Rule 2 bars the jurisdiction of the Court in entertaining asecond suit where the plaintiff could have but failed to claim the entire relief in the first one. Weneed no go into the legal philosophy underlying the said principle as we are concerned with theapplicability thereof.32. Having noticed the effect of a stray observation made by a superior Court viz-a-viz applicabilityof the principle of res judicata we may also notice the applicability of the principle of issue estoppel.34. The question which is, thus, required to be posed is what was in issue in the earlier suit.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/24135. The issue indisputably was the claim of entitlement to Gaddi by the first respondent and a pleacontra thereto raised by the appellants. Once the issue of entitlement stood determined, the samewould operate as res judicata. We may notice some precedents for appreciating the underlyingprinciples thereof. Section 11 of the Code, thus, in view of the issues involved in the earlier suit, theprovisions thereof shall apply.42. Even in a case of title, Explanation IV to Section 11 would apply. (See also Sulochana Amma Vvs.Narayanan Nair: 1994 (2) SCC 14).43. Furthermore in terms of Section 5 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 a suit for possession must befiled having regard to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the statute provides for theapplicability of the Code of Civil Procedure, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that all therelevant provisions thereof shall apply. (See Shamu Suhara Beevi vs. G. Alex and another: (2004) 8SCC 569) & Hardesh Ores (P) Ltd. vs. Hede and Co.:2007 (5) SCC 614)."(emphasis added)."540. In State of U.P. vs. Nawab Hussain, 1977(2) SCC 806 in paras 3 and 7, Court said:"3. The principle of estoppel per rem judicatam is a rule of evidence. As has been stated inMarginson v. Blackburn Borough Council 1, it may be said to be "the broader rule of evidence whichprohibits the reassertion of a cause of action". This doctrine is based on two theories: (i) the finalityand conclusiveness of judicial decisions for the final termination of disputes in the general interestof the community as a matter of public policy, and (ii) the interest of the individual that he should beprotected from multiplication of litigation. It therefore serves not only a public but also a privatepurpose by obstructing the reopening of matters which have once been adjudicated upon. It is thusnot permissible to obtain a second judgment for the same civil relief on the same cause of action, forotherwise the spirit of contentiousness may give rise to conflicting judgments of equal authority,lead to multiplicity of actions and bring the administration of justice into disrepute. It is the cause ofaction which gives rise to an action, and that is why it is necessary for the Courts to recognise that acause of action which results in a judgment must lose its identity and vitality and merge in thejudgment when pronounced. It cannot therefore survive the judgment, or give rise to another causeof action on the same facts. This is what is known as the general principle of res judicata."7. ....That, in turn, led the High Court to the conclusion that the principle of constructive res judicatacould not be made applicable to a writ petition, and that was why it took the view that it wascompetent for the plaintiff in this case to raise an additional plea in the suit even though it wasavailable to him in the writ petition which was filed by him earlier but was not taken. As is obvious,the High Court went wrong in taking that view because the law in regard to the applicability of theprinciple of constructive res judicata having been clearly laid down in the decision in Devilal Modicase, it was not necessary to reiterate it in Gulabchand case as it did not arise for considerationthere. The clarificatory observation of this Court in Gulabchand case was thus misunderstood by theHigh Court in observing that the matter had been "left open" by this Court."Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/242(emphasis added)541. In Bhanu Kumar Jain Vs. Archana Kumar, 2005(1) SCC 787 Court discussed the principles of"issue estoppel" and "constructive res judicata" and said in paras 29 and 30 as under:"29. There is a distinction between "issue estoppel" and "res judicata". (See Thoday v. Thoday)30. Res judicata debars a Court from exercising its jurisdiction to determine the lis if it has attainedfinality between the parties whereas the doctrine issue estoppel is invoked against the party. If suchan issue is decided against him, he would be estopped from raising the same in the latterproceeding. The doctrine of res judicata creates a different kind of estoppel viz. estoppel by accord."(emphasis added)542. The judgment in U.P. State road Transport Corporation Vs. State of U.P. and another, 2005(1)SCC 444 deals with applicability of res judicata between two stages in same litigation. Court relyingon its earlier decision in Satyadhyan Ghosal Vs. Deorajin Debi (supra) in para 11 of the judgmentsaid as under:"11. The principle of res judicata is based on the need of giving a finality to judicial decisions. Theprinciple which prevents the same case being twice litigated is of general application and is notlimited by the specific words of Section 11 of Code of Civil Procedure in this respect. Res judicataapplies also as between two stages in the same litigation to this extent that a Court, whether the trialCourt or a higher Court having at an earlier stage decided a matter in one way will not allow theparties to re-agitate the matter again at a subsequent stage of the same proceedings. (See Satyadhanvs. Smt. Deorajin Devi AIR 1960 SC 941)." (emphasis added)543. Court found, when it had already held that draft scheme dated 13.02.1986 had not lapsed, thecontroversy stood already decided and High Court could not have taken a different view byre-examining the matter. In our view, this judgment does not help appellant for the issue inquestion in this appeal.544. In order to attract principle of res-judicata, amongst others, two integral conditions are thatformer suit must have been between the same parties or under whom they or any of them claimsand second conditions is that parties must have litigated under same title in the former suit.545. Learned counsel for appellant contended that plaintiff pleaded that he was nominated bySwami Krishna Bodhashram before breathing last and, therefore, plaintiff claim his succession andinstallation to the Office of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on the basis of nominationby Swami Krishna Bodhashram which was subsequently approved and accepted by various otherreligious bodies and Shankaracharyas of other Peethas. He submitted that the condition that earliersuit must have been between same party or parties under whom subsequent suit is claimed is wellsatisfied, hence, earlier suit would operate as res-judicata.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/243546. The plaintiff, however, has stated that neither the principle of res-judicata will be attracted inthe case in hand nor the judgment in Original suit No. 36 of 1965 would have any binding effect orotherwise bar on plaintiff from raising any issue which he otherwise could have raised and he cannotbe prevented from raising such an issue on the ground that the same has already been decided inOriginal Suit No. 36 of 1965 for the reason that issue was personal and not to the estate and it diedwith the death of one of the parties since cause of action thereafter did not survive. He argued thatthe Office of Shankaracharya is a matter of status and not connected with property so as to attractprinciple of impleadment or substitution of legal representatives and, therefore, he submitted thatappeal in fact became non prosecutable since cause of action was personal and nothing survivedafter death of one of the party. Therefore, said decision would be of no consequence against plaintiff.He also submitted that plaintiff cannot be said to be legal representative of Swami KrishnaBodhashram for the reason that his installation in the office of Shankaracharya is not by way ofsuccession but it is a separate, individual, independent installation by learned Pandits, otherShankaracharyas and renowned persons having faith in Sanatan Dharm. Therefore, right and claimof plaintiff is totally independent of Swami Krishna Bodhashram. He referred to definition of ''legalrepresentative' under Section 2(11) CPC and contended that by no stretch of imagination, plaintiffcan be treated to be legal representative of Swami Krishna Bodhashram and cause of action wastotally independent and it has nothing to do with installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram in theoffice and on his death therefore whatever litigation has been carried out between the appellant andSwami Krishna Bodhashram or others would have no consequence so far as right and claim ofplaintiff is concerned. He also relied on certain authorities, which we would discuss at a later stage.Now, in the light of principle of res judicata, as discussed above, as also the effect of abatement ofappeal when defendant-appellant has died, we would examine the defence set up by plaintiff asnoticed above.547. The seat of Shankaracharya, as such, is not testamentary in the sense that there is no line ofsuccession in natural or statutory manner but outgoing Shankaracharya, following the customs andusages of nominating his successor, has right to nominate a successor and that is how successor getsinstalled on the seat of Shankaracharya. If no nomination is made by outgoing Shankaracharya andseat is vacated, either on account of his death or otherwise, only in such circumstances a new personcan be selected and installed by Manishigans as propounded in the books of commands i.e."Mathamnaya" and "Mahanushasan", which we have already discussed above. However, for thepurpose of attracting principle of res-judicata, it is not always necessary that there must be arelationship of legal representative. Since plaintiff does not claim himself to be legal representativeof Swami Krishna Bodhashram, it cannot be said that earlier litigation will have no consequence sofar as the plaintiff in the present case is concerned. This assumption is incorrect.548. In our view, it is Explanation-VI of Section 11 CPC which would be attracted in the case inhand. Plaintiff apparently is claiming an occasion of his installation as Shankaracharya due to deathof Swami Krishna Bodhashram on 10.09.1973. According to plaintiff, Swami Krishna Bodhashramwas validly occupying seat of Shankaracharya since 25.06.1953 the same fell vacant after his death.He has also pleaded in the plaint that before death, Swami Krishna Bodhashram was ill and directedplaintiff to look after duties of Shankaracharya which he performed. Further Swami KrishnaBodhashram also recommended plaintiff's installation as Shankaracharya. This admission in theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/244plaint negates plaintiff's contention that following Guru-Shishya Parampara, plaintiff was notnominated by Sri Krishna Bodhashram. It is not necessary that his nomination should have been byway of a 'Will' or by way of any other written document. In para 28 of plaint, plaintiff himself haspleaded that Swami Krishna Bodhashram appointed plaintiff to perform duties of seat ofShankaracharya. Plaintiff managed affairs of Peeth and at the time of death, when he breathed hislast in Delhi on 10.09.1973, Swami Krishna Bodhashram, proposed name of plaintiff for the seat ofShankaracharya. Para 28 of plaint reads as under:"28. That Late Jagatguru Shankaracharya Swami Krishna Bodhashram fell ill in September 1973. Heappointed the plaintiff to perform the duties of the gaddi and to manage the affairs of the Peethaduring the period of his illness. On 10.9.73 Swami Krishna Bodhashram breathed his last at Delhi,the late Shankaracharya proposed the name of the plaintiff for the Gaddi as now ShankaracharyaJyotish Peetha before his death."549. This shows an unequivocal admission on the part of plaintiff that he was nominated by SwamiKrishna Bodhashram. Therefore, plaintiff admittedly, in our view, claimed his installation asShankaracharya pursuant to the nomination made by Swami Krishna Bodhashram. Explanation-VIto Section-11 C.P.C. provides a deeming fiction in respect of a person who is litigating in respect of apublic or private right, common for themselves and others, and all persons interested in such right.Then it says that it should be "deemed to claim" under the persons so litigating. The right of plaintiffis founded on the condition that Swami Krishna Bodhashram was validly holding seat ofShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth since 25.06.1953 and on his death on 10.09.1973, seatfell vacant. Right which was being enjoyed by Swami Krishna Bodhashram after his death is beingclaimed by plaintiff. If Swami Krishna Bodhashram was not holding seat of Shankaracharya,question of acquiring any right by plaintiff after his death would not have arisen.550. Swami Krishna Bodhashram already litigated with regard to his own right with SwamiShantanand and lost. Therefore, same issue could not have been raised by plaintiff, so as to confervalidity upon Swami Krishna Bodhashram with regard to his right to hold seat of Shankaracharya.551. At this stage, learned counsel for plaintiff submitted that his right is totally independent andhas no connection with cause of action relating to Swami Krishna Bodhashram.552. We find ourselves unable to agree with this submission. It is a bundle of facts, as we havealready discussed, giving a cause of action as a result of death of Swami Krishna Bodhashram andplaintiff's assumption that seat of Shankaracharya fell vacant after his death.553. There may be a little bit repetition but we find it necessary to discuss this aspect in detail todeal with the argument which has been vehemently advanced by learned Senior Counsel appearingfor plaintiff.554. The factum regarding nomination of plaintiff by Swami Krishna Bodhashram, as pleaded inpara-28 of plaint, we have already noted above and para-28 has also been quoted.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/245555. Proceeding further, plaintiff states in para-29 and 30 that Shankaracharya of other Peeths,Pandits, learned men, Sanyasis etc. selected and appointed plaintiff as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and installation ceremony was held on 07.12.1973 at Delhi. Para 29 and 30are reproduced as under:"29. That once again the question of appointment arose and the remaining three Shankaracharayaof the different Peethas, the Pandits, learned men, Sanyasi and various religious and followers of thePeetha, selected and appointed the plaintiff as Shankaracharaya of Jyotish Peetha as he possessedall the qualifications prescribed in Mathamanaya and Mahanushashan.30. That installation ceremony of the plaintiff was held at Delhi on 7/12/1973 in whichShankaracharaya of Sharda Peetha and Shankaracharya of Gowardhan Peetha personally offeredpattabhishek to the plaintiff and the Shankaracharaya of Shringeri Peetha had sent hisrepresentatives who offered Patta Vastra on his behalf in the installation ceremony (as he could notcome in the installation ceremony of the plaintiff due to some unavoidable cause). Apart from them,Sanyasis, Grahasts, Pandits and learned Scholars also participated in the ceremony. All thenecessary religious ceremonies were performed."556. He has also pleaded in para 40 and 42 that there cannot be more than one JagadguruShankaracharya in a Peeth, hence there cannot be any occasion for installation of two persons in oneoffice of Jagadguru Shankaracharya. Para 40 and 42 reads as under:"40. That according to the Rules and Regulations of Mathamanaya and Mahanushashan only oneSanyasi having requisite qualification to hold the office of Jagat Guru Shankracharaya is entitled tobe selected and installed. There cannot be more than one Jagat Guru Shankaracharaya in a Peeth,hence in the State of plaintiff having been installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharaya of Jyotishmathas stated above the defendant can not be installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharaya. There is novacancy in the office of Jagat Guru Shankaracharaya of Jyotirmath. Hence no question arises forinstallation of the defendant at the office of Jagat Guru Shankaracharaya of Jyotirmath.""42. That defendant also does not possess the requisite qualification as provided in Mathamanayaand Mahanushashan for being installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharaya of Jyotirmath and therecannot be two persons to be installed as Jagat Guru Shankaracharaya in a Peeth. On this accord toothe defendant is not entitled to be installed as Shankaracharaya for Jyotirmath and hold and possessthe danda chhatra chanwar and Singhasan which office is being held possessed and occupied in theplaintiff. It is the plaintiff who holds and possess the dand chhatra chanwar and Singhasan etc."557. In the Replication also, plaintiff has pleaded that there cannot be two Shankaracharyas at onepeeth. The relevant extract from para 6 is quoted below."6. ... The prohibition is that there cannot be two Shankaracharya on one peeth. Thus the plaintiffhaving been already installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath Badrikashram on 7/12/1973. Thedefendant can not be allowed to claim himself for being installed as jagat Guru Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath Badrikashram on this ground too. Apart from he being disqualified for being installedSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/246and appointment as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath as stated above."558. Further in para-8 of Replication, plaintiff has pleaded that various gifts, donations, offeringsare made by worshippers and followers to Shankaracharya of Peeth and all said offerings are to theOffice and not in the individual capacity of person concerned. Therefore, such property vest in thePeeth and did not remain individual properties of person occupying the office. Para-8 of Replicationto this effect reads as under:"8. That all the gifts, donations and offerings etc. which were made by the worshippers, religiouspersons, and others concerned to Late Brhmanand Sarawswati formerly the Jagat GuruShankaracharya of Jyotirmath were made in the capacity of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath and notin his individual capacity, therefore all such properties vested in the peeth and did not remain as anindividual property of any one. Including that of Brahmanand Saraswati. Allegations, contrary tothis made in the written statement are absolutely incorrect and baseless and is also against the"Sanyas Dharam" and "Sanyasis' working and functioning who has left the worldly untilisations."559. With regard to his installation, plaintiff has stated in para-12 of Replication that Swami KrishnaBodhashram was Chela of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati and installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 25.06.1953 whereupon performed duties of the said office. Plaintiff,disciple of Swami Krishna Bodhashram was installed as Shankaracharya on 07.12.1973. Para-12 and14 of Replication are reproduced as under:"12. That Late Swami Krishna Bodhashram was the Chela of Late Swami Brahma Nand Saraswatiand he was installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath. He therefore performed his duties andobligations of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath as stated in the plaint. The allegations made contraryto this in the written statement are incorrect and baseless.""14. That Swami Swaroopa Nand Saraswati was disciple of Late Swami Krishna Bodhashram. He isduly qualified for the office of Shankaracharya and he has been installed as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath on 7th Dec. 1973 and is discharging his functions duties and obligations ofShankaracharya of Jyotirmath. Late on plaintiff has further been installed as Shankercharya ofDwarika Peeth as well. That shows the plaintiff's full fledged qualifications to hold the office ofShankaracharya of two peethas, i.e. one of Jyotirmath and another that of Dwarika Peeth. ..."560. Besides, in various paragraphs of Plaint and Replication, plaintiff has specifically challengedfactum of installation of Sri Ram Ji Tripathi (Swami Shantanand Saraswati) and Swami VishnuDeva Nand Saraswati on various grounds including that ''Will' was forged, they were not qualifiedetc. PW-6 in his examination in chief (by way of affidavit under Order XVIII Rule 4 CPC) in para-19,20 and 21, has deposed that Swami Brahmanand Saraswati did not execute any ''Will' and alleged''Will' is forged and fictitious. Thereafter, he has further said that persons nominated in the said''Will' are not qualified and could not have been installed or appointed as Shankaracharya. However,in para 26 and 27 of his examination, he has stated that in accordance with ''Will' dated 18.12.1952Sri Ram Ji Tripathi (Swami Shantanand Saraswati) declared his installation as Shankaracharya on12.06.1953. Since, he was not eligible and did not fulfil requisite qualifications, learned Pandits,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/247Sanyasis and members of B.D.M., VNS and K.V.P. and other Shankaracharyas did not acceptinstallation of Swami Shantanand Saraswati and instead installed Swami Krishna Bodhashram asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 25.06.1953 at Gyanvapi, Varanasi. Swami KrishnaBodhashram then continued to discharge duties as Shankaracharya till death on 10.09.1973. He didnot appoint any successor but only recommended and thereafter learned Pandits, Sanyasis ofB.D.M., VNS and K.V.P. and other Shankaracharyas found plaintiff eligible and also taking the factthat Swami Krishna Bodhashram, when unwell, during that period plaintiff looked after functions ofShankaracharya and seat has fallen vacant after death of Swami Krishna Bodhashram, nominatedinstallation of plaintiff on 12.09.1973. Still plaintiff said that he was not actually appointed by SwamiKrishna Bodhashram.

From the aforesaid pleadings and depositions of witnesses, it is evident that plaintiff's entireclaim is founded on the fact that Swami Krishna Bodhashram was installed in the office ofShankaracharya on 25.06.1953 and died on 10.09.1973. After his death seat of Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth fell vacant giving a cause of action for appointment of a newShankaracharya whereupon plaintiff was installed.564. Plaintiff, therefore, founded his claim in the seat left by Swami Krishna Bodhashram. Plaintiffclaimed a right, whether called public or private, in respect of an office which is common to SwamiSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/250Krishna Bodhashram also and unless Swami Krishna Bodhashram held the seat, question of hiscausing any vacancy could and would not have arisen. Therefore, cause of action in the entire matteris a chain of events wherein factum of installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram asShankaracharya, his continuity in the seat and on his death, occurrence of vacancy, is a substantiveaspect, in absence whereof, plaintiff would have no claim at all.565. A 'cause of action' is a bundle of facts giving rise to a dispute and cannot be read in isolationfrom one or the other facts, here and there. What a "cause of action" would mean here, we mayconsider in the light of authorities since it has not been defined as such.566. Generally speaking, as recognized in various authorities, a cause of action is a "bundle of factswhich taken with the law applicable, gives a plaintiff a right to relief against the defendants." (See:Dhanajishaw Vs. Fforde (1887) ILR 11 Bom 649; Musa Vs. Manilal (1905) ILR 29 Bom 368;Raghoonath Vs. Gobindnarain (1895) ILR 22 Cal. 451)567. 'A cause of action' means a situation or a state of facts that entitle a party to maintain action ina Court or a Tribunal; a group of operative facts giving rise to one or more basis for suing; a factualsituation that entitles one person to obtain a remedy in Court from another person. It means everyfact, which, if traversed, it would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to support his rightto a judgment of the Court.568. "Cause of action" denotes whole bundle of material facts based on which plaintiff's relief,prayed for, is based. It is not a piece of evidence of events, but a bundle of events. Neither it has anyrelation with the evidence set up by defendant nor depends upon character of relief prayed for. Itgenerally consists of facts and situation which gives a party, a right to file a suit and obtain a remedyfrom another person, with the help of Court. It gives rise to enforcement of a right through Court oflaw. The "cause of action" thus consists of bundle of facts which give right to enforce legal injury forredress in a Court of law.569. The concept of cause of action is a "bundle of facts required to be proved to show the reason forwhich plaintiff was impelled to go for litigation in Civil Court for recovery of individual rights orredressal of individual wrong etc." In other words, a cause of action is a bundle of facts which arerequired to be proved for obtaining relief. Thus valid installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram wasan integral part of cause of action in this case.570. The issue with regard to valid installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram was alreadydetermined and adjudicated by a competent Court of law, in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965, videjudgment and decree dated 15.01.1970. Issue 5 in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 was in regard toinstallation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram and read as under:"5. Whether defendant no. 1 was installed as Shankaracharya of the Jyotir Mutt on 25.06.1963 asalleged by him in his written statement and if so has he perfected his right as Shankaracharya byadverse possession as pleaded in para 41 of the written statement?"Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/251571. The findings recorded by Sri B.P. Shukla, Civil Judge, Allahabad in the judgment dated15.01.1970, with respect to Issue-5 are as under:-"Now, I discuss the evidence relating to the installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram, defendantno. 1. Ex. A 2 is the copy of the proceedings of Vidwat Parishad Prabandh Karini Samiti, dated8.6.53 at Varanasi twelve persons participated at this meeting. The proceeding indicates thatSecretary of the meeting informed that on 7th June, 1953 at the time of the Bhandara of deceasedJagatguru Ji, it was known in Pandit Sabha that Sri Ramji Tripathi alias Shantanand Saraswaticlaims himself to be the successor of the late Jagadguru on the basis of certain will. It is mentionedthat on talking he appeared to be unqualified so it was decided that a delegation of Pandits shouldmeet Swami Karpatriji and request him to occupy the seat of Sri Jagadguru Shankaracharya. Asshown by Ex. A 3 on 9.6.53 another meeting of Vidwat Parishad Prabandh Karini Sabha took placein which fifteen persons participated. The delegation had met Swami Karpatriji but he declined tothe office of Shankaracharya. It is also mentioned in the proceedings that Swami Karpatriji gave asuggestion that Swami Krishna Bodhashram is a qualified Mahatma and he may be requested toaccept the office of Shankaracharya. Thereafter on 10.6.53 as shown by Ex. A 4 the same body againmet and after the consent of Swami Krishna Bodhashram, 26th June, 1953 was fixed for installationceremony of Swami Krishna Bodhashram. It would thus appear that Kashi Vidwat Parishad took thehistorical decision to install Swami Krishan Bodhashramji. This decision of Vidwat Parishad isalleged to be according to the direction of Adi Shankaracharya to the effect that a non-qualifiedoccupant was liable to be removed. Aaj a daily Varanasi dated 26th June, 1953 has given the newsitem that the installation ceremony of Sri Krishna Bodhashram took place at 10 O'clock near GyanWapi and the function was attended by Shankaracharya of Sharada Peeth as well. In this paper it isfurther mentioned that after the death of late Shankaracharya, the Pandits and assembly of Sadhuselected Sri Krishna Bodhashram for the said office. It is also mentioned in this paper that accordingto the will of late Shankaracharya, Swami Shantanand was installed on the said office.The question is whether there could remain two Shankaracharya of Jyotir Mutt after the death ofSwami Brahmanand. It is noteworthy that according to the will Swami Shantanand had alreadytaken over as Shankaracharya on 12.6.53. Under these circumstances, in my opinion the will havingbeen acted upon, the office of Shankaracharya was already got occupied and there could be no otherShankaracharya in the manner a few section of Pandits of Varanasi wanted to install aShankaracharya. The defendant Swami Sri Krishna Bodhashram is not a disciple of SwamiBrahmanand and that way not connected with Jyotir Mutt, so he cannot have a preferential claimover the disciple plaintiff whom his Guru wanted to be the Shankaracharya. The right of the plaintiffis so secure that even being a Junior Chela he could be the Shankaracharya in preference to thesenior Chelas. In this approach I am fortified by Indian Law Reports Volume 42, Calcutta, paged748, which lays down as under:-"It is consonance with the principles of Hindu law relating to Maurusi Mutt that the senior Chelashould succeed in the absence of valid nomination by the resigning mahant."Moreover, there was three more other persons as nominee in the will and even if for a secondShanta Nand's claim is ignored and also the second nominee Grihasth ignored the qualification ofSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/252nominee nos. 3 and 4 given in the will of Brahmanandji should have been considered by the electivebody. What I mean to say is that initially the choice successor could be made from among thedisciples of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati and if no disciple was found to be suitable then otheralternative of letting in Sanyasis of occupant of the seat of Jyotir Math. According to the followingshloka of Mahanushasan in the presence of a worthy disciple outsider should not have been allowedto be elected. The operation of the Shloka relied in para 28 of the written statement would come intoexistence only when none was found to be suitable out of nominated people or out of the disciples ofSwami Brahmanand Shankar Digvijai Ex. A 106 page 614 Shloka 12 also give similar direction, Viz.Uk tkrq eBeqfPNU|nf/kdkfj.;qifLFkrsA fo/ukukefi ckgqY;kns"k /kEeZ% lukru%AA I have perusedthe evidence on behalf of the defendants and find that nothing is said as to why the claims of theother nominee were overlooked and why in preference to a disciple of Swami Brahmanand anon-disciple was sought to be installed. No doubt, the evidence of Sri Niranjan Deo Tirth Ji,Shankaracharya Puri, D.W. 1, Sri Jagadguru Shankaracharya, D.W. 2 Abhinav Sachchidanand TirthD.W. 3 Sri Narottam Ashram, D.W. 7 Sri Ram Nath Mishra, D.W. 9, Pandit Ram Govind Shukla,goes to indicate that on 25.6.53 ceremony of installation of the defendant no. 1, Sri KrishnaBodhashram took place. I believe what they have said on this point but the above mentionedceremony is wholly insufficient to clothe the defendant no. 1 with the legal title of Shankaracharya ofJyotir Mutt. The reason is that dejure Shankaracharya Swami Shantanand Saraswati had alreadybeen installed on 12.6.63 as Shankaracharya on the strength of the will of Swami BrahmanandSaraswati. The office of Shankaracharya having already been filled up the ceremony dated 25.6.53cannot be the foundation forth acquisition of the title of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath by defendantno. 1. The plaintiff is already in possession in the capacity of Shankaracharya and there is no roomfor the defendant no. 1 being characterised as Shankaracharya by adverse possession as alleged.According to the first resolution of the interim committee of the disciples of Swami BrahmanandSaraswati the will was produced before interim committee. Initially, it was decided to install theplaintiff as Shankaracharya. Later on Pandit Sabha decided that the plaintiff was not a fit personand Sri Krishnabodhashram defendant no. 1 should be installed. The said pandit sabha in myopinion could not sit in appeal over the judgment of Sri Brahmanand Saraswati who nominated hisdisciple plaintiff Sri Shantanand Sarawati, 108 Dandi Swami as successor nominee no. 1. It is patentthat the Bharat Dham Maha Mandal which did Punaruddhar restoration of Jyotishpeet by installingSri Brahmand Saraswati could have the residuary right of appointing successor provided of coursethe reigning Shankaracharya had not nominated any one. The fluctuating body of Pandit Sabhaconsisting of a few persons cannot be considered to be any legal authority to determine the question,upset the decision of the late Jagadguru. Muthamanay is silent on the point as to who is to select thesuccessor. A perusal of the spirit of the judgment of section 92 C.P.C. case shows that if the line ofdisciple is extinct Maha Mandal has a right to nominate. It was impliable even from that thesuccession will be from Guru to Chela and Guru must have some right to nominate. The Guruhaving found the adhikari Uttaradhikari, it will present a chaos if fluctuating body of Pandits ofvarious places in India choose to go on selecting persons of their choice in utter disregard to thewishes of the previous occupant. That is why the decision of section 92 C.P.C. case was required.That is in favour of the plaintiff. The Court under section 92 C.P.C. had a vast power and when it hasnot exercised the power of removing the present occupant, he has to continue office till actuallySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/253removed. In my opinion, the general public could have the power to elect a man only when the lineof disciple was extinct then they could appoint a high qualified person according to book ofcommand shlokas mentioned in para 28 of the written statement. There is no evidence that theentire line of disciples of late Jagatguru is extinct. So a non-disciple like defendant no. 1 could not beappointed as Shankaracharya in preference to disciple. Even if for a second the will in favour ofdefendant No. 1 is held to be illegal, there is the will in favaour of Swami Sri Karpatriji & others.That will become operative. Thus, the Pandit Sabha having not considered the claim of the otherdisciples apart from Sri Karpatriji who declined the offer, it did not lie within the competence of thePandit Sabha to change the line of Succession which has been form Guru to Chela since ages. In Ex.A 91 page 24, Dwarka Jagatguru Shankaracharya writes "According to Math tradition there fourMaths have an unbroken tradition handed from one Acharya to another for last 2,000 years ormore".Thus, the claim of adverse possession of defendant no. 1, cannot at all be sustained." (emphasisadded)572. The above judgment attained finality after dismissal of appeal as abated. So far as SwamiKrishna Bodhashram is concerned, the said issue attained finality in the light of judgment given byCivil Judge. The consequence is that in law, Swami Krishna Bodhashram was not holding seat ofShankaracharya at the time of death. Hence, question of causing any vacancy on his death alsowould not arise. In our view, this issue could not have been agitated again by plaintiff and it isbarred by principle of res judicata as well as a result of finality attached with the judgment anddecree dated 15.01.1970 passed by Civil Judge in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 after abatement ofappeal filed by defendant appellant, Swami Krishna Bodhashram.573. Hence on 10.9.1973, i.e. on the date of Swami Krishna Bodhashram or when allegednomination was made by B.D.M., VNS, K.V.P. and others with respect to plaintiff SwamiSwaroopanand Saraswati or when formal installation took place, throughout it is SwamiShantanand Saraswati who was continuously holding office/position/status of Shankaracharya andsince there was no vacancy of Shankarcharya, question of installation of plaintiff did not arise at all,particularly, considering admission on the part of plaintiff himself that in one Peeth there cannot betwo Shankaracharyas.574. The principle of res judicata is applicable with respect to the issue as well as the suit, both. Theissue whether Swami Shantanand Saraswati was validly installed as Shankaracharya and dischargefunctions of the said office in 1973 and whether Swami Krishna Bodhashram was installed in thesaid office on 25.06.1953 and functioned in the said office till his death, attained finality betweenaforesaid parties in view of judgment and decree dated 15.01.1970 passed in Original Suit No. 36 of1965. That being so, plaintiff, who is admittedly claiming his right of installation on account ofalleged vacancy caused due to death of Swami Krishna Bodhashram, is bound to fail for the reasonthat his claim is common and dependent on Swami Krishna Bodhashram. Once Swami KrishnaBodhashram himself was not holding the said office, question of causing any vacancy giving anyoccasion to plaintiff to get installed on the said seat, does not arise.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/254575. Now coming to the question of alleged removal of Swami Shanta Nand Saraswati and validinstallation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram, though we have already held that judgment in OriginalSuit No. 36 of 1965 decided on 15.01.1970 attained finality after first appeal preferred bydefendant-appellant, Swami Krishna Bodhashram, abated, and, even otherwise, operated as resjudicata on the validity of installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram; still we proceed to satisfyourselves whether Swami Brahmanand was not competent to nominate his successor through 'Will'dated 18.12.1952 and, if yes, after installation of Swami Shantanand on 12.06.1953 whether he wasremoved from the position of Shankaracharya so as to cause a vacancy in which Swami KrishnaBodhashram could have been installed as Shankaracharya on 25.06.1953.576.

Therefore, this NyayaPatra (deed) is being executed for the fulfillment of the aforesaid swajaatiya (co-followers of thereligion) religious works, so that proof remains." (English Translation by Court)577. It is admitted position that Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth after such installation and continued to function till he breathed last on20.05.1953. Before his death, he executed a 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 in which, he gave, in alternative,four names to succeed him as Shankaracharya. The said names were in following order:(i) Ramji Triapthi (subsequently known as Shanta Nand Saraswati),(ii) Dwarika Prasad Shastri,(iii) Swami Vishnu Deva Nand Saraswati,(iv) Swami Parmanand Saraswati.578. Plaintiff challenged aforesaid 'Will' by filing an objection in Misc. Case No. 44 of 1953 filed bySwami Shantanand Saraswati for succession certificate. The objection of plaintiff was rejected andsuccession certificate was issued to Swami Shantanand Saraswati. Thereafter this 'Will' wasSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/256challenged by Swami Krishna Bodhashram in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965, wherein Issue-16 waswith respect to validity of aforesaid 'Will". It was answered in favour of Swami Shantanand. TrialCourt held the said 'Will' valid.579. Same issue was raised in Suit No. 3 of 1954 filed under Section 92 CPC by four plaintiffs,namely, Swami Parmatmanand Saraswati, Nagesh Upadhyay, Mahadev Shastri and Sudarshan LalBajpai, impleading Swami Shantanand Saraswati (Ramji Tripathi) as sole defendant. Issue-5formulated therein was with regard to correctness of 'Will'. There also it was answered againstplaintiffs (in that case), i.e., 'Will' was held validly executed.580. Even in the present case, Court below while adjudicating Issues- 1 and 1/2, declined to go intothe question of validity of 'Will' on the ground that it was already upheld thrice and it would not bepermissible to allow challenge to the said 'Will', by plaintiff, in the suit in question. Relevant extractof judgment in question reads as under:^^mijksDr rhuksa fu.kZ;ksa ls ;g Li"V gS fd olh;r fnukad 18&12&52 fof/kd :i ls fuLrkfjr gq;h gS ---oknh }kjk bl okn esa Hkh olh;r fnuakd 18&12&52 dks pqukSrh nh gS tc fd U;k;ky; bl okn esa bl ijfu.kZ; nsuk mfpr ugha le>rh gS vkSj u gh 1952 dh olh;r dks bl okn esa pqukSrh nh tk ldrh gS** "It isclear from all the three aforesaid judgments that the Will has been executed as per law on 18-12-52.... The Will dated 18-12-52 has been challenged by the plaintiff in this case also whereas in this caseneither the Court finds it appropriate to pass a judgement on it nor the will of 1952 can bechallenged." (English Translation by Court) (emphasis added)581. The above facts are writ large to show that under the deed of trust dated 11.05.1941, body oflearned Pandits, B.D.M., VNS etc., while installing Swami Brahmanand Saraswati asShankaracharya so as to revive extinguished Jyotirmath/ Jyotishpeeth after almost 165 years,followed Teacher-Pupil custom/tradition (Guru-Shishya Parampara) for future succession ofShankaracharyas. It was clearly mentioned that pupil of reigning Shankaracharya, nominated byhim, would succeed the seat of Shankaracharya and shall be known as such. It is only when no suchnomination is available and seat is extinct, i.e., a situation as it was in 1941 when SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati was installed, the same procedure by which Shankaracharya was installed in1941, may be followed by B.D.M., VNS and other learned Pandits, Shankaracharyas etc. Since RamjiTripathi (Swami Shantanand Saraswati) was first in the order of merit nominated by SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati to succeed him as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, he wasentitled to become Shankaracharya and was rightly installed on 12.06.1953.582. Further, whether Swami Shantanand Saraswati suffered any disqualification and for thatreason was removed from the office of Shankaracharya and Swami Krishna Bodhashram wasinstalled by the body of learned Pandits, KVP etc., we have to find a positive act of alleged removal,first. Court below though in the judgment in question, has recognized authority of learned Panditsetc. for removal of a person who gets occupied to the seat of Shankaracharya though not qualified orlacks eligibility or has otherwise committed an act so as to disqualify him to continue asShankaracharya, but thereafter has not recorded any finding, how and in what manner SwamiShantanand Saraswati was removed from the office. Court below has taken the factum that SwamiSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/257Krishna Bodhashram, since was installed on 25.06.1953, this by necessary implication would havethe effect of displacement/removal (nigrah) of Swami Shantanand Saraswati from the seat ofShankaracharya.583. We have already discussed meaning of word 'Nigrah' used in "Mathamnaya" and"Mahanushasan" A person not eligible or otherwise disqualified could have been removed from theoffice of Shankaracharya. We agree that the word 'Nigrah' means 'removal' or 'termination'. Thisrequires a positive act of declaring a person holding seat of Shankaracharya as unqualified ordisqualified or ineligible and thereafter a positive act of his removal from such position so as tocause a vacancy in which another person could have been installed. Installation to the seat ofShankaracharya is not a licence which can be revoked at any time. Here removal has to precede acondition of disqualification. When a person was already holding the said status, there was novacancy in which another person could have been brought in. Therefore, unless and until there isevidence to show that Swami Shantanand Saraswati was removed from the position or status ofShankaracharya, question of installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram could not have arisen. Evenif any formal installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram had taken place, that would have no legaland valid consequence and would not confer status of Shankaracharya upon Swami KrishnaBodhashram. It has to be ignored in law. No document or otherwise evidence has been placed beforeus to show that any conscious decision was taken to declare Swami Shantanand Saraswati as lackingrequisite qualification so as to disqualify him to remain as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and thereupon competent body, i.e., Manishigan removed him and thereafter in theresultant vacancy, installed Swami Krishna Bodhashram.584. Even before Trial Court, neither there was any such issue, nor evidence nor it has beenadjudicated by giving reasons.585. Moreover, Swami Shantanand is/was not a party in present suit. Therefore also Trial Court hadno occasion to look into the issue of alleged disqualification and removal of Swami ShantanandSaraswati. Secondly, in absence of any material, in our view, on pure conjectures and surmises, itcould not have held Swami Shantanand Saraswati as lacking qualification to hold the status ofShankaracharya, and, that too, on the basis of a judgment in which suit was dismissed againstSwami Shantanand Saraswati and another judgment in which his installation as Shankaracharyawas maintained and installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram was declared invalid. Theconjectures on the part of Trial Court in this regard is evident from following extract of judgment (atthe pain of repetition reproduced again) :^^okn la[;k 3@54 o 36@65 ds voyksdu ls Li"V gS fd mUgs laLd`r dk Kku ugha FkkA okn la[;k36@65 ds voyksdu ls Hkh mUgsa laLd`r dk Kku Fkk bl lEcU/k esa dksbZ fu"d"kZ ugha gSA ---ysfdu U;k;ky; dks bl Lrj ij ;g fu.khZr ugha djuk gS fd Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn dks laLd`r dk Kku gS ;k ughAysfdu okn la[;k 3@54 o okn la[;k 36@65 ls vo/kkj.kk yh tk ldrh gSS fd mUgsa laLd`r dk Kku ughFkkA ;gh dkj.k gS fd fo}kuksa euh"khx.k us eBkEuk; egkuq'kklue~ ds izko/kkuksa ds v/khu mudkfuxzg dj Lokeh d`".k cks/kkJe dks 'kadjkpkk;Z ds in ij vklhu djk;kA vU;Fkk vkSj dksbZ dkj.k Lokehd`".k cks/kkJe dks vf/k"Bkfir djus dk ugha FkkA** "It is clear from the perusal of Suit No. 3/54 and36/65 that he didn't possess the knowledge of Sanskrit. No conclusion can be drawn of the fact as toSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/258whether he had knowledge of Sanskrit, even by perusal of Case No. 36/65. ... But at this stage, theCourt has not to decide that whether Swami Shantanand has knowledge of Sanskrit or not. But thiscan be presumed on the basis of Case No. 3/54 and Case No. 36/65 that he didn't had the knowledgeof Sanskrit. This is the reason why Learned wise men abandoned him and anointed Swami KrishnaBodhashram as Shankaracharya as per the provisions of Mathamnay Mahanushashnam. Else, therewas no other reason for anointing (Adhishthapit) Swami Krishan Bodhashram." (EnglishTranslation by Court)586. Trial Court has also taken formal order of abatement passed by First Appellate Court on29.08.1982 rendering judgment dated 15.01.1970 not final on the ground that appeal is continuationof suit, forgetting basic principle of law that abatement of a proceeding is by operation of law. Themere fact that formal order was passed by Court after a long time will not result to a consequencethat appeal was pending. After death of defendant-appellant and non substitution of legalrepresentatives, appeal already abated after expiry of 150 days (90 days+60 days). Swami KrishnaBodhashram admittedly having died on 10.09.1973, first appeal against judgment dated 15.01.1970in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 abated on 10.02.1974. Moreover, abatement of appeal would relateback as if appeal was not filed rendering judgment of Trial Court final which would have the effect inlaw that Swami Shantanand was holding office of Shankaracharya validly and Swami KrishnaBodhashram had no right to the said status. Here also, Trial Court has given a very strangereasoning that in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965, installation of Swami Shantanand was found validand installation of defendant, Swami Krishna Bodhashram, was found to have taken place thoughinvalid for three reasons, namely, he was not pupil of Swami Brahmanand; he could not have beenappointed in the custom of Guru-Shishya Parampara; and, Pandit Sabha could not have appointedany outsider, but since appeal was pending and no formal order of abatement was passed and in themeantime Swami Swaroopanand, plaintiff in the present case, was installed on 07.12.1973,therefore, he (Swami Swaroopanand-plaintiff) was validly installed. This approach, reasoning andfinding is wholly absurd and perverse. This is patently illegal.587. We therefore, have no hesitation in reversing entire findings as aforesaid, namely, regardingalleged disqualification of Swami Shantanand, his removal and also about valid installation ofSwami Krishna Bodhashram. Impugned judgment on Issues-2, 3, 4, 1 and 2/1, in respect ofaforesaid findings is hereby reversed.Answer (Sixth Point):In view of above, we answer the point for determination no. 6 in negative holding that SwamiShantanand Saraswati was not removed from the office of Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth after his installation on 12.06.1953.Answer (Seventh Point):Point for determination no. 7 is answered in negative holding that alleged installation of SwamiKrishna Bodhashram in the seat of Shankaracharya on 25.06. 1953 was invalid, illegal and contraryto the customs, traditions and usages laid down in relevant religious scriptures having force of law,Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/259as discussed in this judgment.Answer (Eight and Ninth Points):Points of determination no. 8 and 9 are answered in affirmative holding that judgment dated15.01.1970 passed in Original Suit No. 36 of 1965 attained finality and would operate as res judicata.Hence the issue regarding valid installation of Swami Shantanand Saraswati in the seat ofShankaracharya and that he was qualified for such installation and that Swami Krishna Bodhashramwas not validly installed on 25.06.1953 would also operate as res judicata and the said judgmentattained finality after appeal abated, in view of judgments of Supreme Court, which we have alreadydiscussed above.588. The Tenth point for determination would be "whether plaintiff has claimed any independentright in the office of Shankaracharya or his claim is connected with the issue of installation of SwamiKrishna Bodhashram?Answer (Tenth Point):This question we have already discussed above while discussing points for determination no. 6, 7, 8and 9 and in view of above discussion, this question is answered in negative and against plaintiff,i.e., in favour of appellant.589. The next two points for determination, i,e. points for determination no. 11th and 12 are:(11) "whether plaintiff has proved that a ceremony for his installation as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth was held on 07.12.1973?"; and, (12) "whether the alleged installation ofplaintiff in the seat of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth in the ceremony held on07.12.1973 conferred a right upon him to hold the said office and can be said to be a validinstallation, particularly when we have already held that Swami Shanta Nand Sarawati was holdingthe said office in 1973 and Swami Krishna Bodhashram having not been validly installed in the seatof Shankaracharya on 25.06.1953 did not cause any vacancy on his death on 10.09.1973?"590. The Issue with regard to installation of plaintiff as Shankaracharya on 7.12.1973 was Issue no.1before Trial Court but with regard to question of installation of appellant as Shankaracharya, TrialCourt has not framed any issue. Instead, it has considered directly whether his installation wasillegal and against Rules, presupposing that ceremony of installation was not disputed but onlyvalidity was to be considered. Issue-1 has been considered by Trial Court alongwith Issue 2/1,whether installation of plaintiff as Shankaracharya was in accordance with Rules or not.591. At this stage, first we will consider whether plaintiff and appellant respectively were able toprove their claim with regard to installation as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. TrialCourt examined this aspect with regard to installation of plaintiff as Shankaracharya, in thejudgment, at pages 282 to 320. It has recorded its conclusion that plaintiff was installed as JagatGuru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 7.12.1973 and has been discharging duties andSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/260functions since then. Court below has simply referred to various evidence, oral and documentary,adduced on behalf of plaintiff without discussing oral evidence with reference to cross-examinationas to whether evidence was credible or not.

However, so far as oral evidence is concerned, we may refer to relevant evidence adduced onbehalf of plaintiff in support of his plea of installation on 7/12/1973 as Shakracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and would also examine whether there is anything to discredit suchevidence or not.595.

Deposition of PW-1 shows a self contradiction and apparent falsity on the part of witness. Italso shows that contents of affidavit filed by way of examination-in-chief are not based oninformation or knowledge of PW-1 but have been written by the person who drafted affidavit. That iswhy in cross-examination, witness showed total ignorance or made contradictory statements inrespect of certain facts which he otherwise authoritatively stated in his examinatin-in-chief by waySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/267of affidavit. On the one hand, he stated that Swami Shantanand Saraswati had no knowledge ofSanskrit and ineligible for installation as Shankaracharya but in cross-examination admitted that hehas no knowledge about eligibility of Swami Shantanand Saraswati. Similarly in respect ofinstallation of Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati as Shankaracharya, he specifically said that he wasformaly installed at Kashi on 12.09.1973 and thereafter held a large function of Abhishek on07.12.1973 at Delhi but in cross-examination he said that he is not aware, where SwamiSwaroopanand Saraswati was installed though he was present. Then he said further that he does notremember whether he was present at the time of installation of Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati ornot. He also said that he does not remember when or in which year Swami Swaroopanand Saraswatiwas installed. Then he also said that he does not know as to how a person is selected and installed asShankaracharya. These contradictory statements of PW-1 render this witness totally unreliable,uncreditworthy and untrustworthy, hence we find no evidentiary value of deposition of PW-1 eitherin support of case of plaintiff or otherwise. We may also observe at this stage that statement madeby PW-1 with regard to alleged disqualification and removal from position of Shankaracharya, ofSwami Shantanand could not have been admitted in evidence for the reason that Swami Shantanandwas not a party in the suit and, therefore, no pleading and evidence which invite finding against theposition of Swami Shantanand could have been admit ted in his absence. Hence this evidence wasinadmissible in absence of Swami Shantanand as party in suit.598.

The deposition of PWs-2, 6, 9, 23, 25, 35 and DWs-1 and 37 and above discussion show that aceremony of installation of plaintiff to place him in the seat of Shankaracharya on 07.12.1973 washeld at Delhi and therefore tenth point for determination is answered in favour of plaintiff.643. However, as we have held that seat was already occupied by Swami Shantanand in 1973 andalleged installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram on 25.06.1953 was invalid and nullity hencethere was no resultant vacancy caused on 10.09.1973 when Swami Krishna Bodhashram died.Therefore the alleged installation of plaintiff as Shankaracharya is of no consequence. It is whollyinvalid and a nullity in the eyes of law. We answer point no. XI against plaintiff and in favour ofappellant.644. In view of above, Questions No.-11 and 12 are answered by holding that there is evidence onrecord to show that ceremony was held for installation of plaintiff in the seat of Shankaracharya on07.12.1973, but his installation is invalid. The finding of Trial Court taking an otherwise view,therefore, to that extent is reversed accordingly.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/281645. With regard to the installation of appellant in the seat of Shankaracharya and holding ofceremony on 14/15.11.1989 no issue has been framed before Court below, hence it does appear thatwith regard to such ceremony, there is no dispute but what has been argued is that installation ofappellant on 14/15.11.1989 in the seat of Shankaracharya was invalid. Hence, now we have toconsider this aspect but before it an incidental issue has been raised that suit, as instituted byplaintiff, rendered infructuous after installation of appellant on 14/15.11.1989 and same we proposeto consider at this stage.646. Point for determination-13, therefore, would be "whether suit in question filed by plaintiffrendered infructuous after installation of appellant in the seat of Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 14/15.11.1989?"647. Sri Goel, learned counsel for appellant at the outset has argued that suit could not havecontinued after installation of appellant on 14/15.11.1989. It rendered infructuous and, therefore, allsubsequent proceedings are illegal. He submitted that amendment sought to be made by applicationfiled on 1.9.2006, having been rejected, would go to show that very relief for which suit forinjunction was filed, had rendered infructous on 14/15.11.1989, after installation ofdefendant-appellant as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, hence, impugned judgmenthaving failed to consider this aspect in accordance with law is clearly erroneous and is liable to beset aside on this ground alone. He urged that this ground goes to the very root of the matter andrenders entire subsequent proceedings inoperative, illegal and of no consequence in law.648. Admittedly, when suit in question was filed, plaintiff initially, vide plaint dated 09.11.1989,sought following reliefs :"A. The defendant may be restrained by means of permanent injunction decree from being installedas Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath Badrika Ashram Himalaya and proclaim himself asJagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath Badrika Ashram and to hold Dand, Chhatra, Chhawarand Singhasan of the office of Shankaracharya of Jyotishpeetha.B. Costs of the suit be awarded in favour of the plaintiff, against the defendant.C. Any other reliefs which deems fit and proper may be awarded in favour of the plaintiff against thedefendant."649. Record shows that it was registered on 10.11.1989. Appellant claimed that he was actuallyinstalled as Jagat Guru Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on 14/15.11. 1989 atBrahmaniwas, Alopi Bagh, Allahabad i.e. when the suit became pending.650. Plaintiff filed amendment application on 1.9.2006 and besides others, he intended to addfollowing relief:"A/1. It be declared that the alleged installation of the defendant as Jagatguru Shankaracharya ofJyotishpeeth Badrikashram, Himalaya Purporting to be done and performed onSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/28214.11.1989/15.11.1989 at Braham Niwas 7, Alopibagh, Allahabad, is invalid, ineffective, illegal andvoid and the defendant got no right and title to hold the office of Shankaracharya Jyotishpeeth,Badrikashram, Himalaya and to function as Jagatguru Shankaracharya of the said peeth."651. This amendment was rejected by order dated 22.12.2006 though some part of amendment ofplaint was allowed but that is not material. We are concerned with part of relief which wasadmittedly rejected by Court below. Sri Goel, learned counsel for appellant contended that rejectionof amendment of plaint shows that challenge to installation of appellant as Shankaracharya by wayof amendment of suit was declined by Court below and that having been done, no further reliefcould have been granted, hence suit as framed and remained pending had already renderedinfructuous and ought to have been dismissed for this reason alone. He said that the Court below infailing to appreciate this aspect and granting injunction by the impugned judgment and decreeingthe suit has clearly erred in law.652. Learned counsel for plaintiff respondent sought to argue that there were three parts of relief inthe plaint as it was filed: (i) for restraining defendant-appellant from installing as Shankaracharya(ii) to restrain him from proclaiming himself as Shankaracharya and (iii) for restraining fromholding Dand, Chhatra, Chanwar and Singhasan of the office of Shankaracharya of Jyotishpeeth.Therefore, relief as framed in the plaint covered every aspect of the matter and even if first part ofrelief, due to any subsequent event, could not have been granted in the same terms, second andthird part of relief covered subsequent events also and hence it cannot be said that the entire suithas rendered infructuous. Then he submitted that pleadings and language used by parties in theplaint or written statement are not to be read as statute but they have to be given naturalpermissible amplitude. Anything which is not included therein, may not be included but ifsomething on its own is covered within the language used by draftsman of the plaint, it has to beread therein and there is no reason to read it strictly or in a pedantic manner.653. The alleged installation of defendant appellant took place on 14/15.11.1989 when suit was dulyinstituted, registered in Court below and was sub judice. The prayer in the plaint, as we have alreadynoticed, can be read to have three parts of relief as under:(i) for restraining defendant-appellant from installing as Shankaracharya;(ii) to restrain him from proclaiming himself as Shankaracharya; and(iii) for restraining from holding Dand, Chhatra, Chanwar and Singhasan of the office ofShankaracharya of Jyotishpeeth.654. So far as second and third parts are concerned, even if plaintiff has occupied seat ofShankaracharya, as claimed, having been installed on 14/15.11.1989, still there is prayer that heshould be restrained from proclaiming himself as Shankaracharya and to hold Danda, ChhatraChanwar and Singhasan of office of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. The aforesaid tworeliefs cover a situation where incumbent, if had already come to the office, still, if justified, suchinjunction could have been granted. Whether such injunction would be granted or not is a questionSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/283to be decided in the light of evidence but the mere factum of installation of appellant on14/15.11.1989 will not render the aforesaid second and third part of reliefs, infructuous. To thisextent we are unable to agree with Sri Goel and reject his submission.655. Even with respect to first part of prayer, we find that an injunction restrainingdefendant-appellant from installation as Shankaracharya implied within itself that unless a personis installed validly and in accordance with law, in the eyes of law, there is no installation asShankarcharya. Hence, even first part of relief can be said to have rendered infructuous only when itis proved before Court, in a Trial, that party concerned has been installed validly and in accordancewith law and only then first part of relief can be said to have rendered infructuous and nototherwise.656. In other words, in our view, mere claim of installation on 14/15th November 1989 cannot beread to have effect of rendering entire suit infructuous for the reason, when prayer is made forpermanent injunction restraining parties from doing or not doing something, it implicates suchaction to be taken or not to be taken, in accordance with law. Therefore, in order to hold first part ofrelief as having rendered infructuous, it is necessary to examine whether alleged installation hadtaken place in accordance with law. If there is no installation in accordance with law, it is noinstallation in the eye of law. Therefore, such invalid installation cannot be taken sufficient to renderthe suit infructuous.657. Judicial review for adjudication of matter cannot be to shut a claim on the ground that what issought to be restrained, has already taken place, unless what has taken place, is in accordance withlaw. If alleged installation of appellant was not valid, plaintiffs are entitled to pray for injunctionrestraining him (defendant-appellant) and also to restrain from exercising powers of office by usingother symbols etc. of such office which are also part of prayer in the plaint. Therefore, for the merefact that defendant-appellant claims to have been installed in the office of Shankaracharya, afterfiling of suit, we find it difficult to hold that suit in its entirety has rendered infructuous and liable tobe dismissed unless we find that installation of appellant is valid and in accordance with law.658. Therefore, the question no. XIII whether entire suit has rendered infructuous after allegedinstallation of defendant-appellant as Shankaracharya on 14/15.11.1989 has to be answered againstappellant for the reason that the second and third part of relief, as noted above, was open to beconsidered by Court and in respect of even first part, unless a finding is recorded that allegedinstallation was valid and in accordance with law, even that part of relief cannot be said to haverendered infructuous.We, therefore, answer Question No.-XIII in negative and against appellant holding that suit did notrender infructuous as pleaded by appellant.659. Now we have to examine capacity of appellant to become Shankaracharya, which has beenanswered in negative by Court below holding him ineligible, unqualified for installation in the seatof Shankaracharya. Points of determination no. XIV and XV are as under:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/284"(XIV) Whether appellant is disqualified, lacking essential qualification/eligibility to becomeShankaracharya of an Amanya Peeth and in particular Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth?""(XV) Whether pleadings lack material facts or relevant particular pointing out the allegeddisqualification on the part of appellant and Court below erred in law by proceeding to consider thisaspect despite lack of appropriate pleading on this aspect?"660. We propose to consider Question-XV first and thereafter will proceed to discuss Question-XIV.661. Sri Goel raised a preliminary objection that there is no specific pleading and material facts arelacking in the plaint with regard to alleged disqualification or eligibility of appellant to hold the seatof Shankaracharya. Therefore, same cannot be gone into and Court below also erred in law inlooking into this aspect. He contended that in the plaint, there was no material fact pleaded withregard to alleged disqualification or lack of qualification on the part of appellant to be installed orappointed as Shankaracharya, therefore, on the basis of averments contained in replication orsubsequent evidence adduced by plaintiff, qualification of appellant to hold the seat ofShankaracharya cannot be examined. He also submitted that by way of amendment plaintiffintended to bring on record specific pleadings with regard to alleged qualification/ disqualificationof appellant for installation as Shankaracharya but proposed amendment having been rejected byCourt below, same could not have been allowed to be examined, indirectly.662. In other words, Sri Goel, learned counsel for appellant, contended that a highly belatedamendment of plaint was sought by plaintiff vide amendment application dated 01.09.2005.Amendment was sought in certain paragraphs of plaint as well as addition of relief. Amendmentapplication vide order dated 22.12.2006, was largely rejected and certain minor amendments in theplaint were allowed. Since amendment for addition of prayer was specifically rejected on the groundthat it is barred by limitation, meaning thereby, the facts which plaintiff desired to bring on recordas a part of pleadings having been rejected, neither by permitting parties to lead evidence norotherwise, in respect of those facts, any finding could have been recorded and Trial Court to thisextent has erred in law.663. Sri Shashi Nandan, per contra, argued that pleadings, already available, if cover a particularaspect, same could not have been ignored and evidence adduced in this regard could not be refusedon the ground that detailed pleadings are not available. The argument is that by way of evidence, anissue raised can be clarified and expanded. Suggestion that mere rejection of amendmentapplication will exclude all those facts sought to be made part of the pleadings by way ofamendment, is misconceived, for the reason that on most of the aspects, basic pleadings wereavailable and plaintiff only wanted to bring on record some detailed facts which Court did notpermit, since it was not necessary.664. Amendment application (paper 366-Ka) is at page 59 of Aappellant's Paper Book, Volume-I. Itis dated 01.09.2005. It shows that application was filed when parties were yet to adduce evidencebefore Court below. Delay was sought to be explained with reference to disposal of ad-interiminjunction application filed under Order 39 Rule 1 C.P.C. and interim injunction was granted onSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/28522.02.1999 restraining appellant from proclaiming himself Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Thereagainst appellant preferred Miscellaneous Appeal No. 41 of 1999,which was dismissed on 27.04.2000 by VII Additional District Judge, Allahabad. Thereagainst,appellant preferred writ petition no. 24085 of 2000, wherein an interim order was passed on22.05.2000 and parties were directed to maintain status quo. Writ petition was finally decided byjudgement dated 23.01.2004 whereagainst both parties preferred Civil Appeal No. 4613 of 2005before Apex Court. Vide order dated 02.08.2005, Court directed parties to maintain status quo.Aforesaid proceedings caused delay in filing amendment which also became necessary due tosubsequent events and claim made by appellant regarding installation as Shankaracharya on14/15.11.1989 i.e. after filing of suit. Amendment was, therefore, requested in the plaint as well asreplication. Plaintiff requested for addition of paragraphs 44/1 and 44/2 in plaint and 22 groundschallenging installation of appellant on the ground of lack of qualification, ineligibility etc. He alsoprayed for addition of relief A/1 after prayer A already made. Prayer A/1 sought to be added in theplaint reads as under:"A/1. It be declared that the alleged installation of the defendant, as Jagatguru Shankaracharya ofJyotishpeeth Badrikashram, Himalay Purporting to be done and performed on14.11.1989/15.11.1989 at Braham Niwas 7, Alopibagh, Allahabad, is invalid, ineffective, illegal andvoid and the defendant got not right and title to hold the office of Shankaracharya Jyotishpeeth,Badrikashram, Himalaya and to function as Jagatguru Shankaracharya of the said Peeth."665. Minor amendment in paragraphs 12 and 14 of replication was prayed i.e. addition of word"Krishna Bodhashram" and deletion of certain words from para 12. Trial Court decided thisapplication vide order dated 22.12.2006. It held that relief sought to be added was clearly barred bytime, hence, in view of law laid down in Radhika Devi v. Bajrangi Singh and Others, AIR 1996 SC2358: 1996 (7) SCC 486, amendment cannot be allowed. Addition of para 44/1 was allowed butaddition of 22 grounds was rejected. Similarly, amendments sought in replication were also rejected.666. Sri Goel argued that plaintiff has failed to plead material facts with regard to allegeddisqualification of appellant, for holding office of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth,hence it could not have been gone into, and for that reason alone, Trial Court ought to have rejectedit. He placed reliance on Raj Narain Vs. Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi and another (1972) 3 SCC 850;Shri Udhav Singh Vs. Madhav Rao Scindia (1977) 1 SCC 511; Kusum Ingots and Alloys Ltd. Vs.Union of India and another (2004) 6 SCC 254; Mahadeorao Sukaji Shivankar Vs. Ramaratan Bapuand others (2004) 7 SCC 181; Anil Basudev Salgaonkar Vs. Naresh Kushali Shigaonkar (2009) 9 SCC310 and Jitu Patnaik Vs. Sanatan Mohakud and others, (2012) 4 SCC 194.667. All the aforesaid authorities relied by Sri Goel had arisen from election dispute except KusumIngots and Alloys Ltd. (supra) which was an appeal decided by Supreme Court, arising from ajudgment of High Court in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution.668. In Raj Narain vs. Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi (supra) matter had come up before Highest Courtfrom an election dispute of Lok Sabha Constituency of Rai Barelilly held in March 1971. Electionpetition was filed by Raj Narain, challenging election of returned candidate Smt. Indira NehruSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/286Gandhi from Rai Bareli Constituency of Lok Sabha in General Elections held in March 1971. Aftercompletion of pleadings and framing of issues, election petitioner moved an application underOrder 11 Rule 7 of Code of Civil Procedure (hereinafter referred to as "CPC") for leave to deliverinterrogatories in writing for the examination of respondent Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi. It wasobjected by respondent contending that Order 11 C.P.C. is not applicable to election petitions andreserving her right to object to interrogatories sought to be served at a later stage. Justice Broomevide order dated 14.09.1971 allowed application and granted leave to election petitioner to deliverinterrogatories for examination of respondent and rejected objections raised by respondent. Duringpendency of appeal respondent filed an application before this Court under Order 11 Rule 7 C.P.C.praying that the interrogatories served on her may be set aside as they were "unreasonable,vexatious, oppressive, unnecessary and irrelevant". 31 interrogatories were served on respondent.All the interrogatories related to Issues 1 to 3. Entire arguments before Trial Court in electionpetition were founded on the ground that election petitioner did not disclose corrupt practices whichwere the subject-matter of Issues 1 to 3. Contention of respondent found favour with Election Judgeand it set aside some of interrogatories served upon respondent. Proceeding further Court alsostruck out issues 1 to 3. Thereafter Raj Narain, election petitioner moved an application foramendment of paragraphs 2 and 5 of election petition by giving better particulars. This applicationwas also rejected by Election Judge on the ground that amendment in question sought to add tomaterial facts and cannot-be accepted after the period of limitation for filing election petition.Earlier appeal filed against the order dated 14.09.1971 before the Supreme Court, against the ordersetting aside the interrogatories served on respondent and striking out of Issues 1 to 3 was registeredas Civil Appeal No. 108 of 1972 and appeal against the order rejecting amendment application wasregistered as Civil Appeal No. 109 of 1972 and these two matters were decided in the aforesaidjudgment dated 15.03.1972. Supreme Court found that out of three issues, Issue 2 was not pressed,Issue 3 was largely consequential to Issue 2. Therefore Court examined only Issue 1 and after goingthrough pleading, observed that while corrupt practice has got to be strictly proved but from that itdoes not follow that a pleading in an election proceeding should receive a strict construction. Even adefective charge does not vitiate a criminal trial unless it is proved that the same has prejudicedaccused. If a pleading on a reasonable construction, could sustain the action, the Court shouldaccept that construction. Courts are reluctant to frustrate an action on technical grounds. Charge ofcorrupt practice in an election is a very serious charge. Purity of election is the very essence of realdemocracy. The charge in question was denied by the respondent. It has yet to be proved. It may ormay not be proved. Allegations made against election petitioner may ultimately be proved to bewholly devoid of truth. However, Court should not refuse to enquire into allegations merely becauseelection petitioner or someone who prepared his brief did not know the language of the law andcould not draft election petition artistically. Court said that it will not non-suit a person for suchtechnical reason. Referring to Sections 83(1) Clauses (a) and (b) and Section 86(5) ofRepresentation of People Act, 1951 (hereinafter referred to as "R.P. Act, 1951"), Court held that if theallegations made regarding a corrupt practice do not disclose the constituent parts of the corruptpractice alleged, the same will not be allowed to be proved and further those allegations cannot beamended after the period of limitation for filing an election petition; but the Court may allowparticulars of any corrupt practice alleged in the petition to be amended or amplified. It furtherobserved that the petition must contain a concise statement of material facts on which petitionerrelies and fullest possible particulars of corrupt practice alleged. 'Material facts' and 'particulars'Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/287may overlap but the word 'material' shows that the ground of corrupt practice and facts necessary toformulate a complete cause of action must be stated. Function of particulars is to present as full apicture of the cause of action as to make the opposite party understand the case, he will have tomeet. If corrupt practice is alleged in the petition, particulars of such corrupt practice may beamended or amplified for ensuring a fair and effective trial, that is, more and better particulars ofthe charge may be given later, even after the period of limitation; but if a corrupt practice is notpreviously alleged in the petition, an amendment which will have the effect of introducingparticulars of such a corrupt practice will not be permitted, after the period of limitation, since, itwill tantamount to making a fresh petition. In other words, Court held that facts stated in thepetition relating to any corrupt practice must be sufficient to constitute a cause of action. The factsmust bring out all the ingredients of corrupt practice alleged. If the facts stated fail to satisfy thatrequirement, then they do not give rise to a triable issue. Such a defect cannot be cured by anyamendment after the period of limitation for filing the election petition. But even if all the materialfacts are stated in the election petition, for a proper trial, better particulars may still be required. Ifthose particulars are not set out in the election petition, they may be incorporated into the electionpetition with the permission of the Court even after the period of limitation. Having said so, Courtsaid :"Rules of pleadings are intended as aids for a fair trial and for reaching a just decision. An action atlaw should not be equated to a game of chess. Provisions of law are not mere formulae to beobserved as rituals. Beneath the words of a provision of law, generally speaking, there lies a juristicprinciple. It is the duty of the Court to ascertain that principle and implement it."669. In the aforesaid facts since sheet anchor was Section 86(5) of R.P. Act, 1951, considering thesame, Court in Raj Narain Vs. Smt. Indira Nehru Gandhi and another (supra) has held as under :"What then is the principle underlying Section 86(5)? In our opinion the aim of that section is to seethat a person accused of a corrupt practice must know precisely what he is accused of so that he mayhave the opportunity to meet the allegations made against him. If the accusation made is nebulousand is capable of being made use of for establishing more than one charge or if it does not make outa corrupt practice at all then the charge fails at the very threshold. So long, as the charge levelled isbeyond doubt. Section 86(5) if satisfied; rest is mere refinement. They either pertain to the region ofparticulars or evidence. That section is not designed to interdict a mere clumsy pleading like thepetition before us. The purpose of that section is to see that every charge of corrupt practice shouldbe brought before the Court before the prescribed period of limitation and none thereafter so thatthe trial of the case may not be converted into a persecution by adding more and more charges or byconverting one charge into another as the trial proceeds." (emphasis added)670. Consequently, Supreme Court allowed appeal by setting aside judgment of Election Judge inregard to Issue 1 and some part of Issue 3. Court also set aside order rejecting amendment andallowed appeal of Election Petitioner in this respect but with regard to interrogatories, some ofwhich were found irrelevant by Supreme Court, to that extent judgment of High Court was upheld.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/288671. In Shri Udhav Singh Vs. Madhav Rao Scindia (supra), again question arose about "materialfacts" and "material particulars" in the context of language of Section 83(1)(a) and (b) of R.P. Act1951. Dispute had arisen of General Elections of Lok Sabha from Guna Parliamentary Constituency,held in March 1971. Respondent Madhav Rao Scindia was declared elected. Election petition wasfiled by Udhav Singh, an elector of the Constituency, on 26.04.1971, challenging election ofrespondent on two grounds. Firstly, elected candidate had incurred or authorized expenditure inexcess of limit of Rs. 35,000/- prescribed under Section 77(3) of R.P. Act 1951 read with Rule 90 ofConduct of Elections Rules, 1961. Second ground was that workers of elected candidate threatenedelectors with bodily injuries and criminally intimidated them not to vote for Shri Deorao KrishnaraoJadhav the Congress candidate. After completion of pleadings and examination of about 12witnesses, an application was filed on behalf of respondent that election petitioner in para 11 (iv) ofelection petition has alleged commission of corrupt practice within meaning of Section 123(2) ofR.P. Act 1951 by Sri Shiv Pratap Singh, another candidate but was not impleaded, therefore, petitionwas liable to be dismissed under Section 86 for non-compliance of mandate of Section 82(b). Thisobjection was upheld and election petition was dismissed. Hence, the matter went to SupremeCourt. Court found that Shiv Pratap Singh was one of the candidates, whose papers were found inorder by Returning Officer but he withdrew his nomination subsequently. However, he was a'candidate' for the purpose of relevant provisions of R.P.Act 1951. One of objections raised beforeSupreme Court on behalf of election petitioner was that objection with regard to non-joinder wasnot taken in written statement but raised for the first time after 14 months and that too, afterexamination of witnesses by election petitioner, hence it amounts to waiver. It was pleaded that inview of mandate of Order 8 Rule 2 C.P.C., all pleas showing petition to be not maintainable shouldhave been taken in written statement. That having not been done, objection with regard to nonimpleadment of Shiv Pratap Singh could not have been taken at advanced stage. Court held thatafter considering issues in the light of Section 82(b), a charge of corrupt practice against candidate,if established, entails serious penal consequences. It has effect of debarring him from being acandidate at an election for considerably a long period, therefore, provision of impleadment of aperson against whom allegations of corrupt practice are made in election petition has been made inSection 82 and it is consistent with fundamental principles of natural justice, i.e. nobody should becondemned unheard. Court observed that requirement of Section 82(b) is nothing but an obligationcast upon election petitioner to join to his petition a candidate against whom allegations of anycorrupt practice are made in election petition and its disobedience inexorably attracts Section 86which commands the High Court in equally imperative language to dismiss an election petitionwhich does not comply with the provisions of Section 82. This requirement cannot be consented orexpress or tacit, so as to waive or condone such non compliance. Court said:"Even inaction, laches or delay on the part of the respondent in pointing out the lethal defect ofnon-joinder cannot relieve the Court of statutory obligation cast on it by Section 86 . As soon as thenon-compliance with Section 82(b) comes or is brought to the notice of the Court, no matter in whatmanner and at what stage, during the pendency of the petition, it is bound to dismiss the petition inunstinted obedience to the command of Section 86." (emphasis added)672. Having said so, Court in Udhav Singh Vs. Madhav Rao Scindia (supra) held that respondentwas neither obliged to raise this objection in written statement nor precluded from raising theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/289objection at a subsequent stage after close of election petitioner's evidence. It observed that Rule 2of order 8 CPC is rule of practice and convenience and justice. This procedural rule is to subserveand not enslave the cause of justice. Referring to language of order 8 rule 2 and in particular, thewords "all such grounds of defence as, if not raised would be likely to take the opposite party bysurprise", Court said that these words denote broad test for determining whether a particulardefence plea or fact is required to be incorporated in the written statement. If the plea or ground ofdefence 'raises issues of fact not arising out of the plaint', such plea or ground is likely to take theplaintiff by surprise, and is therefore required to be pleaded. If the plea or ground of defence raisesan issue arising out of what is alleged or admitted in the plaint, or is otherwise apparent from theplaint, itself, no question of prejudice or surprise to the plaintiff arises. Nothing in the Rule compelsthe defendant to plead such a ground, nor debars him from setting it up at a later stage of the case,particularly when it does not depend on evidence but raises a pure question of law turning on aconstruction of the plaint. Thus, a plea of limitation that can be substantiated without any evidenceand is apparent on the face of the plaint itself, may be allowed to be taken at any stage of the suit.Referring general principles of pleadings, Court said that cardinal canon of interpretation is that apleading has to be read as a whole to ascertain its true import. It is not permissible to cull out asentence or a passage and to read it out of the context, in isolation. It is the substance and notmerely the form that has to be looked into, the pleading has to be construed as it stands withoutaddition or subtraction of words, or change of its apparent grammatical sense. The intention of theparty concerned is to be gathered, primarily, from the tenor and terms of his pleading taken as awhole. Thereafter proceeding to consider distinction between "material facts" and "materialparticulars", Court in paragraphs 41, 42 and 43 said as under:"41. Like the Code of Civil Procedure, this section also envisages a distinction between "materialfacts" and "material particulars". Clause (a) of sub-section (1) corresponds to Order 6, Rule 2, whileclause (b) is analogous to Order 6 Rules 4 and 6 of the Code. The distinction between "materialfacts" and "material particulars" is important because different consequences may flow from adeficiency of such facts or particulars in the pleading. Failure to plead even a single material factleads to an incomplete cause of action and incomplete allegations of such a charge are liable to bestruck off under Order 6, Rule 16, Code of Civil Procedure. If the petition is based solely on thoseallegations which suffer from lack of material facts, the petition is liable to be summarily rejected forwant of a cause of action. In the case of a petition suffering from a deficiency of material particulars,the Court has a discretion to allow the petitioner to supply the required particulars even after theexpiry of limitation.42. All the primary facts which must be proved at the trial by a party to establish the existence of acause of action or his defence, are "material facts". In the context of a charge of corrupt practice,"material facts" would mean all the basic facts constituting the ingredients of the particular corruptpractice alleged, which the petitioner is bound to substantiate before he can succeed on that charge.Whether in an election-petition, a particular fact is material or not, and as such required to bepleaded is a question which depends on the nature of the charge levelled, the ground relied uponand the special circumstances of the case. In short, all those facts which are essential to clothe thepetitioner with a complete cause of action, are "material facts" which must be pleaded and failure toplead even a single material fact amounts to disobedience of the mandate of sec. 83(1) (a).Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/29043. "Particulars", on the other hand, are "the details of the case set up by the party". "Materialparticulars" within the contemplation of clause (b) of Section 83(1) would therefore mean all thedetails which are necessary to amplify, refine and embellish the material facts already pleaded in thepetition in compliance with the requirements of clause (a). 'Particulars' serve the purpose offinishing touches to the basic contours of a picture already drawn, to make it full, more detailed andmore informative." (emphasis added)673. In Kusum Ingots & Alloys Ltd. (Supra) dispute was of a different nature. Appellant was acompany registered under the Indian Companies Act with its registered office at Mumbai. Itobtained a loan from the Bhopal Branch of State Bank Of India, M.P. Bank issued a notice forrepayment of said loan in terms of provisions of Secularization and Reconstruction of FinancialAssets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002. Company questioning the vires of said Act,filed a writ petition challenging consequential repayment notice before the Delhi Court. The saidwrit petition was dismissed by the Delhi High Court for want of territorial jurisdiction. Argumentraised before Supreme Court that constitutionality of Parliamentary Act was in question which hasseat at New Delhi therefore High Court of Delhi has requisite jurisdiction and it is a case of part ofcause of action. Court rejected aforesaid contention and upheld view taken by the Delhi High Court,that there was no territorial jurisdiction. Considering that in order to maintain an action in a Courtof law there must have arisen a cause of action wholly or in part. The term "cause of action" wasexplained by Court in para 6 as under:"6. Cause of action implies a right to sue. The material facts which are imperative for the suitor toallege and prove constitute the cause of action. Cause of action is not defined in any statute. It has,however, been judicially interpreted inter alia to mean that every fact which would be necessary forthe plaintiff to prove, if traversed, in order to support his right to the judgment of the Court.Negatively put, it would mean that everything which, if not proved, gives the defendant animmediate right to judgment, would be part of cause of action. Its importance is beyond any doubt.For every action, there has to be a cause of action, if not, the plaint or the writ petition, as the casemay be, shall be rejected summarily." (emphasis added)674. Relying on Chand Kaur vs. Partab Singh (1987-88) 15 Indian Appeals, 156, Court observed thatcause of action has no relation whatever to the defence which may be set up by the defendant, nordoes it depend upon the character of the relief prayed for by the plaintiff. It refers entirely to theground set forth in the plaint as the cause of action, or, in other words, to the media upon which theplaintiff asks the Court to arrive at a conclusion in his favour.675. Relying on principles of Section 20(c) CPC, Court in Kusum Ingots and Alloys Ltd. Vs. Union ofIndia (supra) reiterated that question of territorial jurisdiction must be founded on the basis ofaverments made in writ petition otherwise it is immaterial. All necessary facts must form an integralpart of cause of action. Mere service of notice would not give rise to cause of action unless service ofnotice was an integral part of cause of action. It relied on its earlier decision in Aligarh MuslimUniversity vs. Vinay Engg. Enterprises (P) Ltd. (1994) 4 SCC 710, where a contract of work wasexecuted at Aligarh; construction work was to be carried out at Aligarh, even the contracts providedthat in the event of dispute, the Aligarh Court alone will have jurisdiction; Arbitrator was fromSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/291Aligarh and was to function thereat. Since the company was a Calcutta-based firm, it institutedpetition in Calcutta High Court and Court held that it was a case of abuse of jurisdiction andCalcutta High Court had no territorial jurisdiction. Court also observed that facts pleaded in writpetition must have nexus on the basis whereof a prayer can be granted. Those facts which havenothing to do with the prayer made therein cannot be said to give rise to a cause of action, whichwould confer jurisdiction on Court. Passing of a legislation by itself does not confer any such right tofile a writ petition unless a cause of action arises therefor. A distinction between a legislation andexecutive action should be borne in mind while determining a question of territorial jurisdiction.Court observed that a Parliamentary Legislation when receives assent of the President of India andpublished in an Official Gazette, unless specifically excluded, will apply to entire territory of India. Ifpassing of a legislation gives rise to a cause of action, a writ petition questioning constitutionalitythereof can be filed in any High Court of the country. It is not so done because a cause of action willarise only when provisions of the Act or some of them which were implemented will give rise to civilor evil consequences to petitioner. A writ Court, would not determine a constitutional question invacuum.676. Mahadeo Rao Sukaji Shivankar vs. Ramaratan Bapu and others (supra), is also a decisionarising from election dispute under the provisions of R.P. Act 1951. Challenging election of MahadeoRao Sukaji Shivankar who was elected from Legislative Constituency, Bhandara, Maharashtra, anelection petition was filed in 1999 at Bombay High Court (Nagpur Bench) by Ramratan Bapu, on theground of corrupt practice adopted by returned candidate. It was alleged that returned candidatedid not submit correct and true accounts, spent unaccounted money and also violated variousprovisions of R.P Act 1951 . Returned candidate while putting appearance, filed written statement,denying allegations contained in election petition. He also filed application under Order 7 Rule 11(a)C.P.C for rejection of election petition on the ground that it did not disclose any cause of action andalso filed another application under Order 6 Rule 16 for striking out certain pleadings from electionpetition. One more application was filed by election-petitioner for granting permission to furnishmaterial particulars of corrupt practice, adopted by returned candidate as alleged inelection-petition. High Court by order dated 15.02.2003 rejected two applications filed by returnedcandidate but allowed application filed by election-petitioner. This order was challenged in appealbefore Supreme Court. Considering meaning of word "material facts" and "material particulars",Court in paragraphs 6 and 7 of judgement said as under :"6........The question, however, is as to whether the petitioner had set out material facts in theelection petition. The expression "material facts" has neither been defined in the Act nor in theCode. It may be stated that the material facts are those facts upon which a party relies for his claimor defence. In other words, material facts are facts upon which the plaintiff's cause of action or thedefendant's defence depends. What particulars could be said to be material facts would dependupon the facts of each case and no rule of universal application can be laid down. It is, however,absolutely essential that all basic and primary facts which must be proved at the trial by the party toestablish existence of cause of action or defence are material facts and must be stated in the pleadingof the party.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/2927. But, it is equally well settled that there is distinction between "material facts" and "particulars".Material facts are primary or basic facts which must be pleaded by the petitioner in support of thecase set up by him either to prove his cause of action or defence. Particulars, on the other hand, aredetails in support of material facts pleaded by the party. They amplify, refine and embellish materialfacts by giving finishing touch to the basic contours of a picture already drawn so as to make it full,more clear and more informative. Particulars ensure conduct of fair trial and would not take theopposite party by surprise." (emphasis added)677. In Harkirat Singh v. Amrinder Singh (2005) 13 SCC 511, distinction between "material facts andmaterial particulars was again pointed out and Court said:"48. The expression 'material facts' has neither been defined in the Act nor in the Code. According tothe dictionary meaning, 'material' means 'fundamental', 'vital', 'basic', 'cardinal', 'central', 'crucial','decisive', 'essential', 'pivotal', indispensable', 'elementary' or 'primary'. [Burton's Legal Thesaurus,(3rd Edn.), p.349]. The phrase 'material facts', therefore, may be said to be those facts upon which aparty relies for his claim or defence. In other words, 'material facts' are facts upon which theplaintiff's cause of action or the defendant's defence depends. What particulars could be said to be'material facts' would depend upon the facts of each case and no rule of universal application can belaid down. It is, however, absolutely essential that all basic and primary facts which must be provedat the trial by the party to establish the existence of a cause of action or defence are material factsand must be stated in the pleading by the party.""51. A distinction between "material facts" and "particulars", however, must not be overlooked."Material facts" are primary or basic facts which must be pleaded by the plaintiff or by the defendantin support of the case set up by him either to prove his cause of action or defence. "Particulars", onthe other hand, are details in support of material facts pleaded by the party. They amplify, refine andembellish material facts by giving distinctive touch to the basic contours of a picture already drawnso as to make it full, more clear and more informative. "Particulars" thus ensure conduct of fair trialand would not take the opposite party by surprise.52. All "material facts" must be pleaded by the party in support of the case set up by him. Since theobject and purpose is to enable the opposite party to know the case he has to meet with, in theabsence of pleading, a party cannot be allowed to lead evidence. Failure to state even a singlematerial fact, hence, will entail dismissal of the suit or petition. Particulars, on the other hand, arethe details of the case which is in the nature of evidence a party would be leading at the time oftrial." (emphasis added)678. Distinction between "material facts: and "material particulars" was also examined in VirenderNath Gautam vs. Satpal Singh (2007)3 SCC 617, where in paragraphs 34 and 35 the Court said asunder:"34. A distinction between "material facts" and "particulars", however, must not be overlooked."Material facts" are primary or basic facts which must be pleaded by the plaintiff or by the defendantin support of the case set up by him either to prove his cause of action or defence. "Particulars", onSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/293the other hand, are details in support of material facts pleaded by the party.

"Particulars" thus ensure conduct of fair trialand would not take the opposite party by surprise.35. All "material facts" must be pleaded by the party in support of the case set up by him.

Particulars, on the other hand, arethe details of the case which is in the nature of evidence a party would be leading at the time oftrial." (emphasis added)679. In Anil Vasudev Salgaonkar versus Naresh Kushali Shigaonkar (Supra) same question wasraised with regard to pleadings whether "material facts" and "full particulars" have been given or notand what is the distinction between two in the context of provisions of R.P. Act 1951. The disputehad arisen from election of Goa Legislative assembly from 35, Sanvordem Assembly Constituency,for which election was held on 2nd June, 2007. Anil Vasudev Salgaonkar was declared elected.Naresh Kumar Shigaonkar was nearest defeated candidate. Election petition was filed on the groundthat returned candidate for securing victory, used corrupt practices by getting 13 bore wellsconstructed at his own cost in seven villages of the said Constituency and also provided ambulancesto those villages namely, Collem, Sanvordem, Mollem, Dharbandora and Khirpal Dabhal as a part ofhis action in luring voters to vote in his favour. Various objections were raised by returned candidateby filing written statement, stating that material facts constituting corrupt practice were not pleadedand, therefore, election petition deserved to be dismissed. High Court rejected objections hence thematter went in appeal before Supreme Court. Court held that with regard to allegation of boring andambulances, there was no pleading that the same was done within the knowledge of returnedcandidate and what was the cost involved in providing the same. There was no pleading as to howvoters were influenced in favour of appellant so as to cast votes in his favour. Particulars of suchvoters were also not given and pleadings were general. Court observed that what particulars are tobe stated must depend on the facts of each case. It is absolutely essential that the pleading, not to beembarrassing to defendants, should state those facts which will put the defendants on their guardand tell them what they have to meet when the case comes on for trial. The word 'material' meansnecessary for the purpose of formulating a complete cause of action; and if any one 'material' fact isomitted, the statement of claim is bad; it is 'demurrable' in the old phraseology, and in the new isliable to be 'struck out'. The Court quoted from Halsbury's Laws of England (4th Edn.) Vol 36, Para38 following passage with approval.."38. Function of particulars.- The function of particulars is to carry into operation the overridingprinciple that the litigation between the parties, and particularly the trial, should be conductedfairly, openly and without surprises, and incidentally to reduce costs. This function has beenvariously stated, namely, either to limit the generality of the allegations in the pleadings, or to definethe issues which have to be tried and for which discovery is required. Each party is entitled to knowthe case that is intended to be made against him at the trial, and to have such particulars of hisopponent's case as will prevent him from being taken by surprise. Particulars enable the other partySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/294to decide what evidence he ought to be prepared with and to prepare for the trial. A party is boundby the facts included in the particulars, and he may not rely on any other facts at the trial withoutobtaining the leave of the Court."680. After referring its earlier decisions, in para 57, Court in Anil Vasudev Salgaonkar Vs. NareshKushali Shigaonkar (Supra) said:"57. It is settled legal position that all "material facts" must be pleaded by the party in support of thecase set up by him within the period of limitation. Since the object and purpose is to enable theopposite party to know the case he has to meet with, in the absence of pleading, a party cannot beallowed to lead evidence. Failure to state even a single material fact will entail dismissal of theelection petition. The election petition must contain a concise statement of "material facts" on whichthe petitioner relies."681. Jitu Patnayak v. Sanatan Mohakud and Others (2012) 4 SCC 194, is also a judgement arisingfrom an election dispute under RP Act 1951. Assembly election of 25- Champua AssemblyConstituency, Orrissa was notified in march 2009 to be held on 23.04.2009. One of contesting andindependent candidate died on 13.04.2009 and his death was allegedly informed to ReturningOfficer. However his name continued in electronic voting machine in the list of contestingcandidates. Jitu Patnaik having secured 27700 votes was declared elected, defeating respondentsSanatan Mohakud who could secure 27555 votes. Deceased candidate Akhila Kumar Mohanta alsogot 550 votes. An election-petition was filed by Sanatan Mohakud. Objections of non pleading ofcause of action and striking of certain allegations by filing applications under Order 7 Rule 11 andOrder 6 Rule 16 CPC were taken. Some of Paragraphs were struck out by Court but it directed toproceed with the election petition. Aggrieved thereby, returned candidate filed appeal in SupremeCourt. Real ground was that due to continuance of name of independent candidate (who died on13.04.2009) on electronic voting machine, 550 votes were cast in his favour and if it would not havehappened, those votes might have been gone to election-petitioner and this has adversely affectedthe election. Court held that there is no provision under R.P. Act 1951 except Section 52, providingfor the consequences following the death of a candidate after publication of list of contestingcandidates under Section 38 and before poll. Conduct of Elections Rules, 1961 also do not providefor such contingency. It provides that only living persons can offer themselves or be offered ascandidates for membership of Parliament or State Legislatures. However, once nomination has beenfiled by a candidate and on scrutiny, his candidature is found proper and before the expiry of theperiod of the withdrawal, he has not withdrawn his candidature and his name is included in the listof validly nominated candidates prepared under Section 38 of R.P. Act 1951 and Rule 11 of the 1961Rules, if death of a contesting candidate as defined in Section 38 takes place, consequencesfollowing the death of such contesting candidate have to be found from electoral law contained inR.P. Act 1951 or the Rules framed thereunder. Right to contest an election or question the election isneither provided in common law nor is a fundamental right but a statutory right regulated bystatutory provision contained in R.P. Act 1951 which is a complete self-contained Code, within whichrights or claim in relation to any election or election dispute must be found. Court said that inabsence of any such provision, death of a candidate would make no impact on the election.Considering question of "material facts" in the light of Section 83(1)(a) of R.P. Act 1951 and order 6Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/295Rule 2 CPC, Court said in paragraph 45 as under:"45. A bare perusal of the above provisions would show that the first part of Order VI Rule 2, CPC issimilar to clause 1(a) of Section 83 of the 1951 Act. It is imperative for an election petition to containa concise statement of the material facts on which the election petitioner relies. What are materialfacts? All basic and primary facts which must be proved at the trial by a party to establish theexistence of cause of action or defence are material facts. The bare allegations are never treated asmaterial facts. The material facts are such facts which afford a basis for the allegations made in theelection petition." (emphasis added)682. From the aforesaid judgements it is evident that the words "material facts" have been read soas to mean that all facts necessary to formulate a complete cause of action. All basic and primaryfacts which must be proved by a party to establish existence of cause of action or defence arematerial facts. "Material facts" in other words, mean the entire bundle of facts which we wouldconstitute complete cause of action.683. Sri Goel also submitted, when parties are prejudiced then mere fact that evidence has beenadduced and entire material is on record hence technical plea of lack of pleading should not beallowed to be raised and relied on certain authorities which we consider as under.684. In Bhagawati Prasad Vs Chandramaul, AIR 1966 SC 735, a suit for ejectment and arrears ofrent and future mesne profits was filed stating that plaintiff is the owner of House No. 59/8,Nachghar, Birhana Road, Kanpur. It was pleaded that plaintiff and defendant were friends andenjoying mutual confidence. When the house was constructed, defendant wanted some premises forresidence, hence when the ground floor was constructed it was let out to defendant on a monthlyrent of Rs.150/- in 1947. In 1948, first floor was completed and the same was also let out todefendant on an additional rent of Rs.150/- per month and in 1950 second floor was constructedand the same was also let out to defendant on a further additional rent of Rs. 150/- per month. Thetotal rent therefore, came to Rs. 450/- in 1950 which was continuously paid by defendant till31.03.1954. Thereafter it committed default, hence suit for ejectment and recovery of arrears of rentwas filed. Defendant took the defence that though land was owned by plaintiff but the house raisedthereat was constructed by defendant from his own fund and it was agreed that so long as theexpenses incurred by defendants in construction of house are not clear would be entitled to continueto stay thereat. Trial Court rejected the defence of defendant and held ownership in favour ofplaintiff but in respect to rent it held that Rs. 300/- per month is the reasonable rent and passeddecree of ejectment and arrears of rent monthly Rs. 300/-. In appeal preferred before High Court,the findings of Trial Court with regard to ownership of house and rent both were confirmed but thenHigh Court held that in view of U.P. (Temporary) Control of Rent and Eviction Act, 1947(hereinafter referred to as "Act 1947") in respect whereto an Ordinance was issued somewhere in1946, letting out of building without permission of District Magistrate was not permissible andtherefore it modified the decree and while confirming the decree for ejectment set aside the decreewith regard to rent and mesne profits. In appeal preferred before Supreme Cout by both sides, onbehalf of defendant it was argued that High Court has made a new case for the plaintiff and once itheld that tenancy was not valid in law even decree of ejectment would not have been granted. CourtSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/296held that decision of the case cannot be based on grounds outside the pleadings of parties and it isthe case pleaded that has to be found as held in Trojan and Company Ltd. Vs Rm.N.N. NagappaChettiar, AIR 1953 SC 235. However it observed that said observations were made with regard toclaim made by plaintiff for certain sum of money on the ground that defendant had sold certainshares belonging to him without his instructions but plaintiff failed to prove that sale had not beenauthorized by him. In Bhagwati Vs Chandramaul (supra) Court said:"if a party asks for a relief on a clear and specific ground, and in the issues or at the trial, no otherground is covered either directly or by necessary implication, it would not be open to the said partyto attempt to sustain the same claim on a ground which is entirely new."685. In making aforesaid observations, Court relied on its earlier decision in Sheodhar Rai andothers Vs Suraj Prasad Singh and others, AIR 1954 SC 758, but thereafter it has said that forconsidering the application of doctrine of facts of the case, it is necessary to bear in mind the otherprinciple that considerations of form cannot over-ride the legitimate considerations of substance. Itsaid:"If a plea is not specifically made and yet it is covered by an issue by implication, and the partiesknew that the said plea was involved in the trial, then the mere fact that the plea was not expresslytaken in the pleadings would not necessarily disentitle a party from relying upon it if it issatisfactorily proved by evidence. The general rule no doubt is that the relief should be founded onpleadings made by the parties. But where the substantial matters relating to the title of both partiesto the suit are touched, though indirectly or even obscurely in the issue, and evidence has been ledabout them, then the argument that a particular matter was not expressly taken in the pleadingswould be purely formal and technical and cannot succeed in every case. What the Court has toconsider in dealing with such an objection is : did the parties know that the matter in question wasinvolved in the trial, and did they lead evidence about it ? If it appears that the parties did not knowthat the matter was in issue at the trial and one of them has had no opportunity to lead evidence inrespect of it, that undoubtedly would be a different matter. To allow one party to rely upon a matterin respect of which the other party did not lead evidence and had had no opportunity to leadevidence, would introduce considerations of prejudice, and in doing justice to one party, the Courtcannot do injustice to another."686. The manner in which the aforesaid principle could have been applied is also clear from furtherdiscussion from paras 13 and 14 of judgment in Bhagwati Vs Chandramaul (supra) and it would beuseful to reproduce the same as under:"13. When Mr. Setalvad was pressing his point about the prejudice to the defendant and theimpropriety of the course adopted by the High Court in confirming the decree for ejectment on theground of licence, we asked him whether he could suggest to us any other possible plea which thedefendant could have taken if a licence was expressly pleaded by the plaintiff in the alternative. Theonly answer which Mr. Setalvad made was that in the absence of definite instructions, it would notbe possible for him to suggest any such plea. In our opinion, having regard to the pleas taken by thedefendant in his written statement in clear and unambiguous language, only two issues could ariseSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/297between the parties : is the defendant the tenant of the plaintiff, or is he holding the property as thelicence subject to the terms specified by the written statement ? In effect, the written statementpleaded licence, subject to the condition that the licence was to remain in possession until theamount spent by him was returned by the plaintiff. This latter plea has been rejected, while theadmission about the permissive character of the defendant's possession remains. That is how theHigh Court has looked at the matter and we are unable to see any error of law in the approach by theHigh Court in dealing with it.14. In support of its conclusion that in a case like the present a decree for ejectment can be passed infavour of the plaintiff, though the specific case of tenancy set up by him is not proved, the HighCourt has relied upon the two of its earlier Full Bench decisions. In Abdul Ghani v. MusammatBabni I.L.R. 25 All. 256 the Allahabad High Court took the view that in a case where the plaintiffasks for the ejectment of the defendant on the ground that the defendant is a tenant of the premises,a decree for ejectment can be passed even though tenancy is not proved, provided it is establishedthat the possession of the defendant is that of a licensee. It is true that in that case, before givingeffect to the finding that the defendant was a licensee, the High Court remanded the case, because itappeared to the High Court that that part of the case had not been clearly decided. But once thefinding was returned that the defendant was in possession as a licensee, the High Court did not feelany difficulty in confirming the decree for ejectment, even though the plaintiff had originallyclaimed ejectment on the ground of tenancy and not specifically on the ground of licence. To thesame effect is the decision of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Balmakund v. Dalu I.L.R. 25All. 498."687. Court upheld the judgment of this Court which founded on two Full Bench judgments in AbdulGhani VS Musammat Babni, I.L.R. 25 All. 256 and Balmakund Vs Dalu, I.L.R. 25 All. 498, whereinit was held, where the plaintiff asks for the ejectment of the defendant on the ground that defendantis a tenant in the premises, a decree for ejectment can be passed even though tenancy is not proved,provided it is established that the possession of the defendant is that of a licensee. Court observedthat importance of pleadings cannot be ignored because it is the pleadings that lead to framing ofissues in the suit and a trial in every civil case has inevitably to be confined to the issues framed inthe suit. The whole object of framing the issues would be defeated if parties are allowed to travelbeyond them and claim or oppose reliefs on grounds not made in the pleadings and not covered bythe issues. But cases may occur in which though a particular plea is not specifically included in theissues, parties might know that in substance, the said plea is being tried and might lead evidenceabout it. It is only in such a case where the Court is satisfied that the ground on which reliance isplaced by one or the other of the parties, was in substance, at issue between them and that both ofthem have had opportunity to lead evidence about it at the trial and the formal requirement ofpleadings can be relaxed. Court held that High Court was impressed by the thought that once thedefendant was shown to be in possession of the suit premises as a licensee, it would be futile torequire the plaintiff to file another suit against the defendant for ejectment on that basis and thisapproach of Court was held justified by Supreme Court. Thereafter Court also considered the appealof plaintiff which was against that part of judgment of High Court where the rent and mesne profitswere denied and the Court held that once it was found that plaintiff was entitled to eject defendant,for the period defendant was in possession of property he was liable to pay mesne profit or damagesSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/298for use and occupation of said property and therefore, the decree for ejectment must have beenaccompanied by a direction for payment of future mesne profits or damages.688. In Mohan Lal Vs Anandibai and others, 1971 (1) SCC 313, Court, as a matter of fact, found thatpleadings did not contain any reference with regard to fraudulent or antedating of sale deed. Noissue was framed. For the first time during arguments before Trial Court, question of fraud and pleaof antedating was sought to be raised for the first time during course of arguments. In these factsand circumstances, Court considered the fact that there was no opportunity to other side to leadevidence or objection regarding fraud or antedating as a new plea could not have been allowed at thestage of hearing either before Trial Court or before Appellate Court. Court said:"since no issue was framed, no occasion arose for the plaintiff-respondents to give evidence toexplain the delay in registration. No question was put to any witness of the plaintiff-respondentswhy this delay had occurred The plea depended on questions of fact in respect of which evidencecould have been given and facts elicited. Such a plea could not be considered for the first time at theappellate stage when the party concerned had no earlier warning and did not have any opportunityto give evidence explaining the reason for the delay." (emphasis added)689. Similarly with regard to objection raised during course of argument before Trial Court, againCourt said:"there was no justification for the trial Court to hold the question and record this finding when therewere no pleadings in respect of it and, even during the course of trial, evidence was not led with theobject of meeting such a plea." (emphasis added)690. The judgment itself shows that principle laid down therein is unexceptional but would apply tocases where facts are similar and not otherwise.691. In Kidar Lall Seal and another Vs Hari Lall Seal, AIR 1952 SC 47, Court observed:"I would be slow to throw out a claim on a mere technicality of pleading when the substance of thething is there and no prejudice is caused to the other side, however clumsily or inartistically theplaint may be worded. In any event, it is always open to a Court to give a plaintiff such general orother relief as it deems just to the same extent as if it had been asked for, provided that occasions noprejudice to the other side beyond what can be compensated for in costs." (emphasis added)692. In Nagubai Ammal and others Vs B. Shama Rao and others, AIR 1964 SC 164, Court observed:"the objection was raised that if no plea of lis pendens was taken in the pleadings and consequently,the evidence bearing on that question could not be properly looked into, and no decision could begiven based on the documents that the sale was affected by lis."693. Rejecting this argument Court held:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/299"that rule has no application to a case where parties go to trial with knowledge that a particularquestion is in issue, though no specific issue has been framed thereon, and adduce evidence relatingthereto." (emphasis added)694. In Kunju Kasavan Vs M.M. Philip, I.C.S. and others, AIR 1964 SC 164, an argument was raisedthat deposition of witnesses could not be looked into when there was no proper plea of issue.Rejecting the same Court said:"We do not think that the plaintiff in the case was taken by surprise. The notification must havebeen filed with the written statement, because there is nothing to show that it was tenderedsubsequently after obtaining the orders of the Court. The plaintiff was also cross-examined withrespect to the address of Bhagavathi Valli, and the only witness examined on the side of thedefendant deposed about the notification and was not cross-examined on this point. The plaintiffdid not seek the permission of the Court to lead evidence on this point. Nor did he object to thereception of this evidence. Even before the District Judge, the contention was not that the evidencewas wrongly received without a proper plea and issue but that the notification was not clear andthere was doubt whether this Bhagavathi Valli was exempted or not. The parties went to trial fullyunderstanding the central fact whether the succession as laid down in the Ezhava Act applied toBhagavathi Valli or not. The absence of an issue, there-fore, did not lead to a mistrial sufficient tovitiate the decision."695. In Bachhaj Nahar Vs Nilima Mandal and another, (2008) 17 SCC 491, a suit was filed fordeclaration, possession and injunction against Bachhaj Nahar and Sujash Kumar Ghosh. Suitproperty was a strip of land which was claimed to be owned by plaintiff under sale deed dated29.12.1962. The reliefs sought in the suit read as under:"(i) declarations that (a) the plaintiffs are the absolute owners in possession of the suit property; (b)the defendants do not have any right, title or interest or possession in respect of suit property; and(c) the first defendant had illegally encroached and started construction in the suit property;(ii) a direction to first defendant to deliver possession of the suit property to plaintiffs afterdemolishing the construction over the same; and(iii) a permanent injunction restraining first defendant from interfering with the suit property."696. Defendant resisted the suit contending that he had purchased land from second defendantunder sale deed dated 05.05.1982 and suit land actually is his property. Trial Court formulatedfollowing eight issues:"(i) Is the suit as framed maintainable?(ii) Have the plaintiffs got any cause of action to file the suit as against these defendants?(iii) Is the suit barred by limitation and also on the principle of waiver estoppel and acquiescence?Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/300(iv) Whether the description of the suit land is vague?(v) Whether the suit land is part and parcel of land of the plaintiff purchased through registeredkewala or the suit land in exclusive possession of Ishan Chand Ghosh, and after his death of seconddefendant, and after purchase of first defendant.(vi) Has first defendant encroached any portion of the suit land?(vii) Whether the plaintiffs got title over the suit land? Or were they using the suit land underexpress permission of the late Ishan Chand Ghosh and his son?(viii) To what relief or reliefs, plaintiffs are entitled?"697. Trial Court decreed suit, in part, holding that suit property was part of plaintiffs' property andfirst defendant had encroached over it to the extent of 15 sq. ft. and raised construction thereat.Therefore, instead of restoring possession, it allowed damages and compensation for suchencroached portion to the plaintiff. Defendant filed appeal and plaintiff filed cross objection. FirstAppellate Court held that plaintiffs failed to prove their title and therefore, allowed defendant'sappeal and dismissed plaintiff's cross objection and reversed the decree of Trial Court.Consequently, suit was dismissed. In the second appeal preferred by plaintiff, High Court upheldfindings of First Appellate Court that plaintiff failed to make out title of the suit property but eventhen proceeded to hold that plaintiff had made out a case for grant of relief based on easementaryright of passage, in respect of the suit property and allowed appeal decreeing suit based oneasementary right of plaintiff though there was neither any pleading nor issue nor evidence withregard to easementary right. Supreme Court held that High Court, when there was no pleading orevidence on the question of right of easement, in its zeal to cut delay, has violated severalfundamental rules of Civil Procedure which are:"(i) No amount of evidence can be looked into, upon a plea which was never put forward in thepleadings. A question which did arise from the pleadings and which was not the subject matter of anissue, cannot be decided by the Court.(ii) A Court cannot make out a case not pleaded. The Court should confine its decision to thequestion raised in pleadings. Nor can it grant a relief which is not claimed and which does not flowfrom the facts and the cause of action alleged in the plaint.(iii) A factual issue cannot be raised or considered for the first time in a second appeal."698. It is in this background, Court in Bachhaj Nahar Vs Nilima Mandal (supra) explained objectand purpose of pleading in framing issues and said in paras 12 and 13, as under:"12. The object and purpose of pleadings and issues is to ensure that the litigants come to trial withall issues clearly defined and to prevent cases being expanded or grounds being shifted during trial.Its object is also to ensure that each side is fully alive to the questions that are likely to be raised orSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/301considered so that they may have an opportunity of placing the relevant evidence appropriate to theissues before the Court for its consideration. This Court has repeatedly held that the pleadings aremeant to give to each side intimation of the case of the other so that it may be met, to enable Courtsto determine what is really at issue between the parties, and to prevent any deviation from thecourse which litigation on particular causes must take.13. The object of issues is to identify from the pleadings the questions or points required to bedecided by the Courts so as to enable parties to let in evidence thereon. When the facts necessary tomake out a particular claim, or to seek a particular relief, are not found in the plaint, the Courtcannot focus the attention of the parties, or its own attention on that claim or relief, by framing anappropriate issue. As a result the defendant does not get an opportunity to place the facts andcontentions necessary to repudiate or challenge such a claim or relief. Therefore, the Court cannot,on finding that the plaintiff has not made out the case put forth by him, grant some other relief. Thequestion before a Court is not whether there is some material on the basis of which some relief canbe granted. The question is whether any relief can be granted, when the defendant had noopportunity to show that the relief proposed by the Court could not be granted. When there is noprayer for a particular relief and no pleadings to support such a relief, and when defendant has noopportunity to resist or oppose such a relief, if the Court considers and grants such a relief, it willlead to miscarriage of justice. Thus it is said that no amount of evidence, on a plea that is not putforward in the pleadings, can be looked into to grant any relief." (emphasis added)699. In Ram Sarup Gupta Vs Bishun Narain Inter College, AIR 1987 SC 1242, Court said:"6....It is well settled that in the absence of pleading, evidence, if any, produced by the parties cannotbe considered. It is also equally settled that no party should be permitted to travel beyond itspleading and that all necessary and material facts should be pleaded by the party in support of thecase set up by it. The object and purpose of pleading is to enable the adversary party to know thecase it has to meet. In order to have a fair trial it is imperative that the party should state theessential material facts so that other party may not be taken by surprise. The pleadings howevershould receive a liberal construction, no pedantic approach should be adopted to defeat justice onhair splitting technicalities. Sometimes, pleadings are expressed in words which may not expresslymake out a case in accordance with strict interpretation of law, in such a case it is the duty of theCourt to ascertain the substance if the pleadings to determine the question. It is not desirable toplace undue emphasis on form, instead the substance of the pleadings should be considered.Whenever the question about lack of pleading is raised the enquiry should not be so much about theform of pleadings, instead the Court must find out whether in substance the parties knew the caseand the issues upon which they went to trial. Once it is found that in spite of deficiency in thepleadings, parties knew the case and they proceeded to trial on those issue by producing evidence, inthat event it would not be open to a party to raise the question of absence of pleadings in appeal."(emphasis supplied)700. Referring to the law of Easements, Court in Ram Sarup Gupta (supra) said that it has certainrelevant facts to establish and unless there is a pleading or issue or evidence the same cannot beassumed so as to give relief and in paras 19, 20 and 21 said as under:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/302"19. Easements may relate to a right of way, a right to light and air, right to draw water, right tosupport, right to have overhanging eaves, right of drainage, right to a water course etc. Easementscan be acquired by different ways and are of different kinds, that is, easement by grant, easement ofnecessity, easement by prescription, etc. A dominant owner seeking any declaratory or injunctiverelief relating to an easementary right shall have plead and prove the nature of easement, manner ofacquisition of the easementary right, and the manner of disturbance or obstruction to theeasementary right.20. The pleadings necessary to establish an easement by prescription, are different from thepleadings and proof necessary for easement of necessity or easement by grant. In regard to aneasement by prescription, the plaintiff is required to plead and prove that he was in peaceful, openand uninterrupted enjoyment of the right for a period of twenty years (ending within two years nextbefore the institution of the suit). He should also plead and prove that the right claimed was enjoyedindependent of any agreement with the owner of the property over which the right is claimed, as anyuser with the express permission of the owner will be a licence and not an easement. For claiming aneasement of necessity, the plaintiff has to plead that his dominant tenement and defendant'sservient tenement originally constituted a single tenement and the ownership thereof vested in thesame person and that there has been a severance of such ownership and that without theeasementary right claimed, the dominant tenement cannot be used. We may also note that thepleadings necessary for establishing a right of passage is different from a right of drainage or right tosupport of a roof or right to water course. We have referred to these aspects only to show that aCourt cannot assume or infer a case of easementary right, by referring to a stray sentence here and astray sentence there in the pleading or evidence.21. A right of easement can be declared only when the servant owner is a party to the suit. Butnowhere in the plaint, the plaintiffs allege, and nowhere in the judgment, the High Court holds, thatthe first or second defendant is the owner of the suit property. While concluding that the plaintiffswere not the owners of the suit property, the High Court has held that they have a better right ascompared to the first defendant and has also reserved liberty to the plaintiffs to get their titleestablished in a competent Court. This means that the Court did not recognize the first defendant asthe owner of the suit property. If the High Court was of the view that defendants were not theowners of the suit property, it could not have granted declaration of easementary right as no suchrelief could be granted unless the servient owner is impleaded as a defendant. It is alsoununderstandable as to how while declaring that plaintiffs have only an easementary right over thesuit property, the Court can reserve a right to the plaintiffs to establish their title thereto by aseparate suit, when deciding a second appeal arising from a suit by the plaintiffs for declaration oftitle. Nor is it understandable how the High Court could hold that the apart from plaintiffs, otherpersons living adjacent to and north of the suit property were entitled to use the same as passage,when they are not parties, and when they have not sought such a relief."701. In the present case injunction was sought against appellant from functioning asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotispeeth on various grounds and one pleaded in para 42 is thatappellant did not possess requisite qualification as provided in Mathamnay and Mahanushasan soas to be installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/ Jyotispeeth. Material particulars, therefore, forSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/303seeking relief of injunction against appellant with respect to qualification, in our view, is covered bypleadings of para 42 of plaint. What qualifications are needed for installation as Shankaracharya, inreference thereof, plaintiff has referred to Mathamnay and Mahanushasan. Further details as towhat qualifications are prescribed in aforesaid books of commands is a matter of evidence and forthat purpose evidence has been led by both parties. In our view, it cannot be said that materialparticulars are not given in this respect which were necessary for grant of relief to plaintiff. Detailsthereof is a matter of evidence and that is what has been done by both parties by leading evidence. Itis also not the case where appellant has been taken by surprise that issue of disqualification hasbeen raised without any pleading whatsoever in plaint. The only thing is that specificdisqualification has not been mentioned but it cannot be construed as if material particulars are notprovided which is necessary for grant of relief inasmuch as pleading with regard to disqualificationof appellant with reference to qualifications prescribed in Mathamnay and Mahanushasan hasspecifically been averred in para 42 of plaint. In view of law discussed above and looking topleadings in plaint, we find ourselves unable to agree with Sri Goel that there is defect of materialparticulars provided in plaint and hence question of disqualification of appellant could not havebeen looked into by Court below. We, therefore, reject this submission.702. Sri Goel also contended that replication is not part of pleading and, therefore, facts statedtherein for the first time could not have been treated to be part of pleadings so as to go into thequestion relating to qualification/disqualification of appellant based on facts stated in replication.703. The above submission is also of no substance for the reason that we have already held thatbasic pleading is already existing in plaint. Even in respect of replication the argument advanced bySri Geol, we find, difficult to accept.704. Provisions relating to pleadings are contained in Orders 6, 7 and 8 C.P.C. Order 6 deals withpleading in general. Order 7 deals with plaint and Order 8 deals with written statement. Order 6Rule 1 defines pleadings stating that pleadings shall mean plaint or written statement. Sub-rule (3)provides the form of pleading which should be the form in Appendix 'A' where applicable, and wheresame is not applicable, in the form of like character as nearly as may be. The said appendix does notcontain anything by way of form relating to replication. Apparently in the provisions of CPC we findno reference to term 'replication' but under Order 8 Rule 9 it has been provided that no pleadingsubsequent to written statement of a defendant other than by way of defence to set off or counterclaim shall be presented except by leave of Court. Meaning thereby a subsequent pleading can beentertained by Court by granting permission and thereupon if it finds necessary it may requiredefendant to file an additional written statement also. It is admitted case that in the present caseafter filing of replication, and then amendment of plaint, an additional written statement was filedby appellant.705. Replication was filed in 1995. At no point of time appellant has taken any objection beforeCourt below. In 2006 an amendment was allowed in plaint permitting insertion of a paragraph andsome minor amendments. Thereafter appellant also filed an additional written statement. It wasalways open to appellant to reply the facts stated in replication but in additional written statementappellant chose to reply only to the extent amendment was allowed in plaint. Issues were framed bySwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/304Court below on the basis of pleadings of parties. Thereafter parties led evidence which includedissue relating to disqualification of appellant to hold the seat of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. When matter has been decided, now for the first time, issue of lack of pleading isbeing raised in this appeal. Firstly, as we have already said, pleading with regard to disqualificationof appellant was already there in plaint. Secondly, that we are of the view that replication has onlyclarified some aspects and not constitutes a pleading in respect of a fact stated for the first timetherein and, thirdly, as no objection was raised by appellant before Court below, issues were framedby Court below with the consent of both parties and thereafter parties have also led evidence andissue has been decided, we find no substance in aforesaid argument. Some authorities have alsobeen relied by learned counsel for appellant that replication is not part of pleadings unlesspermitted by Court, but looking to the facts of this case we find nothing therein so as to helpappellant in support of his wide submission with regard to absence of material particulars as noticedabove. The point for determination no. 15, therefore, is answered against appellant.706. Now we come to the Question-XIV regarding disqualification of appellant. Trial Courtformulated Issues 12 and 13, "whether appellant did not possess requisite qualification forinstallation in the seat of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth" and "whether allegedinstallation of appellant on 14/15.11.1989 in the seat of Shankaracharya was invalid and illegal."Relating to installation of appellant, another Issue 7 was formulated "whether SwamiVishnudevanand Saraswati was entitled and competent to execute a 'Will' or otherwise nominatesuccessor for installation as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. In regard to competenceof Sri Vishnudevanand Saraswati for execution of 'Will' or nomination, Court below has alsoformulated Issue 6 "whether installation of Sri Vishnudevanand Saraswati was in accordance withthe line of succession led by Sri Swami Brahmanand Saraswati, vide 'Will' dated 18.12.1952."707. Issues 6 and 7 both have been answered by Court below against appellant. Similarly, Issues 12and 13 have also been answered in favour of plaintiff and against appellant.708. We have already discussed above that succession of Shankaracharya in Amnaya Peeth has totake place as per settled and well established customs, usages and traditions of "Guru-ShishyaParampara". Existing Shankaracharya who is holding position, nominates his successor and that ishow line of succession continues. The only exception is, when other persons, can select a person asShankaracharya for installation when no such nomination has been made by outgoingShankaracharya. We have also discussed above that in Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, First Installation ofShankaracharya namely Swami Trotokacharya, was performed by Adi Shankaracharya himself.Thereafter a continuous line of succession exists where appointment of successor has been made byoutgoing Shankaracharya, except when Swami Ram Krishna who died in 1776 A.D., (Vikram Samvat1833) could not nominate his successor, whereupon Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth seat remained inoblivion for almost 165 years. It was revived in 1941 by congregation of Manishigan which included"B.D.S.,VNS" , Shankaracharyas of other three Amnaya Peeths and learned Pandits etc. ThereuponSwami Brahmanand Saraswati was selected and installed. After installation, "Swami BrahmanandSaraswati" was entitled to nominate his successor in accordance with old traditions and customs,which had continued for several hundred years and has gained status of law for appointment ofShankaracharya in Amnaya Peeth. This right of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati was also recognizedSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/305in Trust Deed dated 11.05.1941, which fact also we have discussed above.709. It is true that Swami Brahmanand Saraswati while exercising his right of nomination ofsuccessor, gave four names, but in our view, aforesaid Will dated 18.12.1952 containing four nameswas applicable only as one time nomination. If person placed at serial no. 1 declined, only thenperson at serial no. 2 could have staked his claim for installation as Shankaracharya. But as soon asperson having better priority accepts his nomination, authority of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati tocontrol succession in the seat of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth would cease for thereason that thereafter person nominated and installed as Shankaracharya, at the time of hisoutgoing from the seat, would have a right to nominate his own successor. In other words, RamjiTripathi i.e Swami Shantanand Saraswati was the first person, nominated by Sri SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati in 'Will' dated 18.12.1952. He accepted his nomination and was installed inthe seat of Shankaracharya on 12.06.1953. After his installation, further nomination vide 'Will' dated18.12.1952, by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati became otiose and redundant since 'Will' attained itspurpose and became inoperative for future. Thereafter Swami Shantanand Saraswati acquired aright to nominate his successor in the seat.710. Trial Court while deciding Issue 6, has misdirected itself as if rule of inheritance in perpetuitycould have been applied to four nominations made by Swami Brahmanand Saraswati vide 'Will'dated 18.12.1952. This assumption on the part of Court below, in our view, is clearly erroneous andgoes contrary to the custom and tradition i.e. Guru Shishya-Parampara established for appointmentof Shankaracharya in Amnaya Peeth. A person once appointed cannot control succession inperpetuity. No such custom and tradition was ever recognized or at least shown to us to exist.Therefore, conclusion and finding of Court below that nomination and installation of SwamiVishnudevanand Saraswati as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth was not in accordancewith nomination made in the 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 is erroneous and we reverse the same. We holdthat 'Will' dated 18.12.1952 stood exhausted as soon as the person having better priority, nominatedtherein, accepted his nomination and was installed in the seat of Shankaracharya. Thereafter rightof further succession would have to be exercised by such person who got installed and not by earlierone.711. We have already held that Swami Shantanand Saraswati was installed on 12.06.1953 and thereis no evidence to show that he was actually removed from the seat. Therefore, he continued asShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth till he himself withdrew by tendering resignation on28.02.1980 (Paper No. 159C (Exhibit-12). As an outgoing Shankaracharya, Swami ShantanandSaraswati was entitled to nominate his successor. It is a different thing that following wishes of hisown Guru, he exercised his own power of nomination in favour of "Swami VishnudevanandSaraswati". In our view, this nomination by Swami Shantanand Saraswati was consistent with wellestablished customs or usages for appointment of Shankaracharya in Amnaya Peeth as alreadydiscussed. Hence, installation of Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati in the seat of Shankaracharyaon 28.02.1980 by Swami Shantanand Saraswati cannot be said invalid. The factum that SwamiShantanand Saraswati made nomination, giving weightage to wishes of his Guru SwamiBrahmanand Saraswati, would not make such nomination irregular, illegal or contrary to customsand usages for the reason that it was sole discretion of Swami Shantanand Saraswati to makeSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/306nomination and, for that purpose, he could have followed any principle or policy which could nothave been controlled or monitored by any external agency or person(s). Letter of resignation dated28.02.1980 of Swami Shantanand Saraswati has not been found forged. There is no otherwiseevidence to show that Swami Shantanand Saraswati did not nominate Swami VishnudevanandSaraswati as his successor to the seat of Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Therefore,findings of Court below recorded otherwise, while deciding Issues 6 and 7, in our view, are perverseand hence we reverse the same. In fact, we find no reason, logic or rationale in the findings of Courtbelow that Swami Shantanand Saraswati nominated Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati in violationof nominations contained in the Will dated 18.12.1952, executed by Swami Brahmanand Saraswatithough he could not have violated the said Will. Court below has not referred any reason why SwamiShantanand Saraswati could not have exercised his authority of nomintion without being controlledby anyone.712. While answering Issue 6, finding recorded by Court below, reads as under:^^mijksDr nLrkosth vkSj ekSf[kd lk{; ls Li"V gS fd Lokeh 'kkUrkuUn ljLorh }kjk vius LorU=vf/kdkjksa ls Lokeh fo".kwnsokuUn ljLorh dks 'kadjkpk;Z ugha cuk;k cfYd olh;r fnukad 18-12-52 dkmYya?ku djus ds i'pkr cuk;k x;kA blls ;g Hkh Li"V gS fd uEcj 2 }kjdk izlkn f=ikBh dks Lokeh'kkUrkuUn ljLorh blfy;s 'kadjkpk;Z ugha cukuk pkgrs Fks D;ksafd mUgksaus Lokeh 'kkUrkuUnljLorh dh v;ksX;rk ds vk/kkj ij gh fojks/k fd;k Fkk] tks 159lh esa Hkh vafdr gSA tc fd O;fDrxr dkj.k lsLokeh 'kkUrkuUn ljLorh] Lokeh czg~ekuUn ljLorh dh olh;r dk mYya?ku ugha dj ldrs FksA vr% Li"VgS fd Lokeh fo".kwnsokuUn ljLorh dh fu;qfDr Lokeh czg~ekuUn dh olh;r ds vuq:i ugha dh x;h Fkhftlds dkj.k Ãij fudkys x;s fu"d"kZ ds dkj.k mudh fu;qfDr voS/k Fkh rFkk tks Lokeh Lo:ikuUn ljLorhds vf/k"Bkiu dh iqf"V djrh gSA** "This is clear from the aforesaid oral and documentary evidencethat Swami Shantanand Saraswati did not appoint Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati asShankaracharya, by exercising his own independent right, rather appointed him after Will dated18.12.1952 was violated. This is also clear from it, that Swami Shantanand Saraswati did not wish toinstall Sri Dwarka Prasad Tripathi, (named) at Serial No.2 (in the will), as Shankaracharya, for thereason that he had opposed Swami Shantanand Saraswati on the ground of his disqualifications,which fact is also endorsed in 159C. Whereas Swami Shantanand Saraswati could not, for personalreasons, violate 'Will' executed by Swami Brhamanand Saraswati. Therefore, it is clear thatappointment of Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati was not made in accordance with 'Will' of SwamiBrhamanand Saraswati, on account whereof and in view of the findings recorded above, hisappointment was illegal and the Court confirms installation of Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati."713. For the reason discussed above, aforesaid finding is patently illegal and Trial Court havingfailed to consider that Will of Swami Brahmanand Saraswati stood exhausted and consummated assoon as one of four persons nominated by him, having better priority, accepted and was installed inthe seat of Shankaracharya. Thereafter, the new person would have his own right of succession bynomination.714. Now, since we are upholding nomination of Swami Vishnudevnand Saraswati for installation asShankaracharya by virtue of right of nomination of outgoing Shankaracharya, (Swami ShantanandSaraswati), we have no manner of doubt in upholding right of Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati toSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/307execute a 'Will' for nomination of his own successor.715. Trial Court has not held that Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati did not execute 'Will' dated17.04.1989 or the said Will was forged or fictitious document or was not executed properly or forany other reason, but has rejected the said 'Will' only on the ground that since Swami ShantanandSaraswati did not nominate Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati properly, therefore, 'Will' executedby Swami Vishnudevnand Saraswati is also bad. This is erroneous, contrary to established customregarding nomination of successor and we reverse it.716. One of the arguments advanced on behalf of plaintiff is that the Will dated 17.04.1989 executedby Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati did not nominate appellant, rather it is a mere delegation toanother person which was not permissible. It is also pointed out that 'Will' dated 17.04.1989 wasunregistered, not signed by Executor and he died on 01.11.1989. After his death, 'Will' was gotregistered at Lucknow on 14.12.1989. It is pointed out that Trial Court has not examined that 'Will'was not proved as contemplated by provisions of Indian Succession Act, 1925 and Indian EvidenceAct, 1872. There existed a number of suspicious circumstances to show that 'Will' was not genuine,hence, the said 'Will', shall not confer a valid right of succession upon appellant. It is also said thatthe 'Will' delegated right of nomination to Shantanand Saraswati who ceased to be aShankaracharya and therefore also, ultimate nomination of appellant was not valid. Reliance isplaced by learned counsel for plaintiff on the law laid down in H. Venkatachala Iyengar vs. B. N.Thimmajamma & others AIR 1959 SC 443, (paras 18-21, serial no. 14) Rani Purnima Devi AndAnother vs Kumar Khagendra Narayan Dev And another, AIR 1962, 567 (para 5-23) and JagdishChandra Sharma Vs. Narain Singh Saini, (2015) 8 SCC 615 (para 21,22,46,48 ). Sri Shashi Nandan,learned Senior Counsel for plaintiff also pointed out that expert opinion of PW 42, Sri MadanMohan Kakkar Handwriting and Fingerprint expert, appearing on behalf of plaintiff was placedbefore Court below who opined that 'Will' was not genuine. An otherwise report of DW 42 SriRadhakrishna Gupta, Handwriting and Fingerprint expert, was also placed in evidence by appellant.Court below, he urged has erred in not considering these aspects and the same may be looked intoby this Court. He submitted that 'Will' was produced before Court below after evidence of plaintiffwas over. There was nothing to show that signatures tallied. Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati wasnot competent to write 'Will' and, therefore, there was no valid nomination in favour of appellant, soas to validate his installation as Shankaracharya on 14/15.11.1989.717. With regard to nomination of outgoing Shankaracharya, no specific procedure has been laiddown in Mathamnaya/ Mahanushasan or any other religious scriptures, governing customs orusages for installation of Shankaracharya in the four Peeths, established by Adi Shankaracharya. Wedo not find any evidence on record to show that Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati did not nominateappellant. Appellant himself appeared in witness box as DW-3 and stated that he was nominated byhis Guru and outgoing Shankaracharya and that is how, he was installed on 14/15.11.1989.

We find no otherwise evidence adduced by plaintiff that such desire or nomination was notexpressed or made by Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati. In absence of any particular procedureprescribed or laid down in the customs and traditions, as we have discussed above, even a mere oralnomination in our view, would be sufficient to validate succession in the seat of Shankaracharya.Even if 'Will' is ignored, we are of the view that Swami Vishnudevanand Saraswati was entitled andSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/310competent enough to make nomination of his successor and, in view of evidence discussed above,we hold that he nominated appellant as his successor and pursuant thereto, ceremonies ofinstallation of appellant as Shankaracharya were held on 14/15.11.1989. The findings otherwise,recorded by Court below in the impugned judgment and decree are reversed.721. Now the only question to be considered is, "Whether appellant was qualified, eligible andcompetent to be installed as Shankaracharya."722. Learned counsel for plaintiff has pointed out that Court below has rightly held appellantincompetent, lacking essential qualification to become a Shankaracharya as neither he attainedSanyas in the manner prescribed i.e. established customs and usages, nor ever lived that life till thedate he claimed to have been installed as Shankaracharya and, therefore, injunction granted byCourt below against appellant deserved to be sustained.723. On the contrary, Sri Manish Goel submitted that Sanyas was adopted by appellant in 1983 andthereafter he lived life of full sacrifice and mere fact that he was employed will not render disqualifyhim to become Shankaracharya. He contended that strict discipline of Sanyasi provided in oldscriptures, with change of time, is difficult to follow and, therefore, concept of Sanyasi and life of aSanyasi should be considered in the light of present day realities. He said that whatever salary wasreceived by appellant, it was spent on welfare of people and not consumed for personal benefit.Therefore, he requested that this Court should not apply stringent conditions applicable to a personadopting Sanyas as contemplated in old scriptures like, Sanyasopnishad.724. Various disqualifications of appellant have been endeavored to be placed before us by learnedcounsel for appellant, namely, appellant was suffering with contagious decease, had no properknowledge of traditions, Vedas, Upnishads etc., he was employed in job and getting salary even afterthe date when he claimed to have adopted Sanyas (reclusion) in 1983, therefore, he was notcompetent to be installed as Shankaracharya.725. It is very seriously contended that in fact, appellant neither adopted 'Sanyas' nor went inreclusion, in the manner, contemplated and provided in various scriptures including'Sanyasopnishad', nor he ever followed life of a Sanyasi, hence, he lacked basic requirement for theseat of Shankaracharya. In fact, after the so called date of taking reclusion (Sanyas), appellantthroughout remained in employment till 13.11.1989, i.e. just the day earlier to date of his allegedinstallation. He was never a 'Sanyasi' as per established customs or usages having force of law hence,incompetent to hold seat of Shankaracharya.726. We find that evidence oral as well as documentary is available on record on the issue ofemployment of appellant, PW 33 Sri Raj Narain Tripathi, was a Teacher appointed in Jyotispeeth inSanskrit Mahavidyalaya, Shankaracharya Ashram, Alopibagh, Allahabad on 01.09.1967. He wasappointed as Head of Department of Literature in the said institution on 01.04.1979. He furtherdeposed that appellant whose earlier name was Somnath Dwivedi, was appointed as Head ofVedanta Department on 10.08.1979 and worked till 13.11.1989 and received salary. It is also pointedout that aforesaid institution, in which, appellant was appointed and worked, is an aided institutionSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/311from the State Government.

Please explain as to nature of leave sanctioned tothose teachers." (Page 2090 Paper no. 538C/126C (Exhibit 132) (Page 2089 Volume IV respondentpaper book)(English Translation by Court)733. Exact date of adopting reclusion (Sanyas) of appellant has not been stated but we find that it isan admitted case that from 10.08.1979 to 13.11.1989 appellant was working as a Teacher (Head ofDepartment of Vedanta) in the aforesaid institution, which was in grant in aid and salary was paidfrom State Exchequer. In these circumstances, we enquired from Sri Manish Goel, learned counselfor appellant, when appellant adopted Sanyas and lived life of a Sanyasi, that too a Dandi Sanyasi,which is one of the foremost and basic qualification for installation as Shankaracharya. We did notreceive any clear answer to this specific query, which we repeatedly made from Sri Manish Goel,learned counsel for appellant. The only defence taken by appellant in this regard is that there was nopleading regarding his alleged disqualification, therefore, this issue could not have been gone into byCourt below and even this Court should not look into this aspect. With regard to pleadings, we havealready discussed the matter in detail and rejected.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/318734. As already pointed out, issue has been framed and parties have led evidence in whichemployment and period of employment of appellant has been given in detail. In this regard, ownwitnesses of appellant have given much details.735. We also find that appellant claims to have resigned on 13.11.1989 from said employment and onthe very next day attended his installation ceremony as Shankaracharya without placing anything onrecord to show that said resignation was ever accepted by competent authority. In servicejurisprudence an employee continues to be employed till his relationship is severed by employer inaccordance with terms of service contract or if service is governed by statutory provisions, inaccordance with procedure laid down thereunder.736. Facts as evident are that from 10.8.1979 onwards appellant was in continuous employment. Heresigned on 13.11.1989 and on the very next date got installed as Shankaracharya. It is in the midstof above period, that is, in 1983, appellant claimed to have adopted reclusion (Sanyas). This claim ofreclusion in 1983 is nothing but a fraud on the concept of 'Sanyas' by any stretch of imagination. Aswe have already held, unless a person is Dandi Sanyasi (a recluse having a stick), living a life ofrecluse, as propounded under customs, usage and traditions having force of law, he cannot become aShankaracharya of Amanya Peeth. Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that appellant wasineligible and unqualified for being installed as Shankaracharya and alleged installation of appellanton 14/15th November 1989 is patently a farce, illegal and nullity, being contrary to customs, usages,traditions and norms laid down in this regard which have force of law. We, therefore, uphold findingof Court below that the appellant was not eligible or competent to hold the seat of Shankaracharyaof Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. Points for determination no. XIV and XV are answered againstappellant.737. Next point for determination is whether Court below erred in law in not staying proceedings ofsuit in question in view of pendency of Original Suit no. 1A of 1974, under Section 10 CPC.738. Section 10 CPC reads as under:"10. Stay of suit. No Court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is alsodirectly and substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties, orbetween parties under whom they or any of them claim litigating under the same title where suchsuit is pending in the same or any other Court in India having jurisdiction to grant the reliefclaimed, or in any Court beyond the limits of India established or continued by the CentralGovernment and having like jurisdiction, or before the Supreme Court.Explanation- The pendency of a suit in a foreign Court does not preclude the Courts in India fromtrying a suit founded on the same cause of action.739. Suit 1A of 1974 was filed by plaintiff, seeking declaration that he is validly installedShankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth. This declaration he did not seek in rem but impleadedonly three defendants in the said suit i.e. Ramji Tripathi (Swami Shantanand Saraswati), DwarikaPrasad Tripathi and Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati. Declaration, therefore, plaintiff sought in theSwami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/319aforesaid suit, was against aforesaid three persons only. One of them i.e. Swami ShantanandSaraswati was in the seat of Shankaracharya and rest two were nominees in 'Will' dated 18.12.1952.One of the conditions to attract section 10 CPC is that both suits should be between same parties orbetween the parties any one of which came litigating in the same title. Trial court rejectedapplication of appellant seeking stay of proceedings in suit in question. We are also of the view thatcondition of section 10 CPC are not attracted in the case in hand. Therefore, there was no error onthe part of Court below in not staying the proceedings of suit in question. Aforesaid question is,therefore, answered against the appellant.740. In view of above findings, impugned judgment and decree passed by Court below grantinginjunction against appellant, restraining from functioning as Shankaracharya ofJyotirmath/Jotishpeeth has to be sustained but it would not result in recognition of right of plaintiffto function as Shankaracharya of said Peeth, particularly, in view of our finding that plaintiff wasnever installed as Shankaracharya at Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeh, validly, inasmuch as seat was notvacant in 1973. Consequently, an eventuality has cropped up when an important religiousdenomination would face a vaccum or state of vacancy where an Amnay Peeth likeJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeh at Badrikasharam will have no suitable person to function asShankaracharya. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. In larger public interest and in theinterest of religious denomination as well as followers and devotees of the said Amnay Peeth, anappropriate direction is necessary to be given to fill in this gap. In our view, this Court whiledeciding appeal under Section 96 CPC, can exercise its power under Order 7 Rule 7 C.P.C. read withSection 151 C.P.C. by directing for holding congregation of Manishigan (scholars), learned men,Pandits etc. to follow the same procedure as was followed in 1941, to select a most suitable, qualifiedand eligible person and install him as Shankaracharya at the aforesaid Peeth within a period of threemonth and till then parties should maintain status quo as on day.741. Before parting with this judgment, we find it appropriate to place on record our serious concernand disapproval to the situation prevailing nowadays, where people holding such a high, pious andrevered seat/status, like Shankaracharya of an Amanya Peeth, engage in a chain of litigation fordecades together. In fact, appellant himself in his oral desposition as DW 3 has stated that disputeswith regard to Shankaracharya, raising parallel claim also exist in Dwarika Peeth, Sharda Peeth andGovardhan Peeth too. Even DW 37, Sri Bhramchari Atmanand, and 39, Sri Shailendra KumarTiwari, have similarly deposed and the same is reproduced as under:DW 37, Sri Bhramchari Atmanand Sishya ^^bUgha dk mnkgj.k ysdj iqjh ihB] }kfjdk ihB ij gj txgdbZ&dbZ Lo;aHkw 'kadjkpk;Z mRiUu gks x;s gSa Â¼isij ua0&981d] ist&727Â½ Taking reference ofhis dispute, many self-proclaimed Shankaracharya mushroomed up at many places such as PuriPeeth, Dwarika Peeth.

The same situation is in Puri also. (Paper no. 982 Ka, Page-779)(English Translation by Court)742. This situation prevailing in such significant and pious places of religious faith and belief ishighly deplorable and condemnable. Court can take judicial notice of the fact that people have deeprooted faith in religion and donate generously to religious endowments etc. This has resulted inamassing a huge wealth with such religious establishments and properties movable and immovableowned by these institutions is multiplying day by day. Some temples in the Country possess wealthto the extent comparable even with annual budget of Government of India and may exceed annualbudgets of some Provinces. Wealth has brought in evil of disputes and litigation. That is what we arewitnessing. In fact, a large number of unscrupulous religious establishment/institutions havecropped in. In many cases deceptive and mischievous people have intruded in these institutions, orhave created their own institution(s) by usurping titles which are highly revered and respected andin whom people at large repose blind and deep faith. Such unscrupulous, dishonest and immoralpersons or their institutions and their beneficiaries, creators and associates, are exploiting anddeceiving innocent religious people and believers in Dharma. This has also resulted in creating anumber of false, mischeiveous persons/entities entering the field of religion in the form ofPreachers, Acharya, Kathavachaks etc. delivering religious discourses. Many of them havingestablished their own Maths, suo motu conferring upon them title of Mathadhipati, Peethadhishwar,Jagatguru Shankaracharya and likewise, without any legal authority, imitating titles which they arenot entitled to hold and use otherwise. Recent incidents in religious arena, unearthing evil deeds ofso called Heads of various religious establishment and their accomplices, putting them behind bar,have shaken not only believers in Hindu Religion but the entire Nation. This state of affairs is quiteshocking. Now time has come when common people and in particular all concerned religiousdenominations need immediate protection from such exploitation. State must intervene by makingrequisite provisions in this regard. We hope and trust that concerned State (including CentralGovernment) shall look into this matter at the earliest and take appropriate steps to curtail andeliminate imitation, creation of imposters and tendency of litigation in religious endowments andalso to regulate and control their activities with a view to prevent imitation, misrepresentation,fraud, cheating, usurpation etc. by unwanted and unauthorized persons.743. In the last but not the least, we shall be failing in our duty if we not put on record credit due topersons who made this voluminous work convenient for us to complete. Record of this appeal isrunning in several thousands of pages. Merited and diligent assistance of S/Sri Manish Goel,Permeshwar Nath Mishra, Shashi Nandan, Wajahat Hussain Khan and Anoop Trivedi have madethe things quite convenient for us to scan entire record, citations etc. Court Masters S/Sri PradeepKumar Jaiswal, Sushil Kumar and Pawan Kumar Chaurasia have also put in their hardest labour insifting of required record and place before us during hearing as well as preparation of judgment.Undaunted, relentless day and night work rendered by Private Secretaries, S/Sri Akhilesh KumarNayak, Awadhesh Kumar, Puneet Srivastava, Pravin Verma and Shubham Agrahari also deserve dueappreciation and commendation.Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/321744. In this case judgment was reserved on 03.01.2017. However, sitting of one of us (Hon'bleSudhir Agarwal, J.) at Lucknow was notified w.e.f. 09.01.2017 and same continued for three rosters.Therefore, preparation of judgment could be possible only whenever one of us (Hon'ble SudhirAgarwal, J.) came to Allahabad for holding Court. Ultimately to complete the work having no otheroption one of us (Hon'ble Sudhir Agarwal, J.) went on leave for one week in August, 2017 andanother week in September, 2017 and that is how work has been completed. Some delay occurred incompleting judgment for reasons beyond our control.Summary of Judgment745. In view of our discussion, summary of our findings is as under:(1) Swami Shantanand Saraswati was installed as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth on12.06.1953.(2) There is no evidence whatsoever that Swami Shantanand Saraswati was disqualified or did notfulfill qualification for being installed as Shankaracharya and also no evidence to show that he wasremoved from the office on the ground of any disability or disqualification.(3) Since Swami Shantanand Saraswati was already installed as Shankaracharya on 12.06.1953,there was no vacancy in the office hence installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram asShankaracharya on 25.06.1953 was invalid and illegal.(4) Judgment dated 15.01.1970 passed by Civil Judge in OS No. 36 of 1965 deciding issue ofinvalidity of installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram and valid installation of Swami Santanandin the office of Shankaracharya, attained finality after appeal filed by appellant-Swami KrishnaBodhashram abated on his death. Plaintiff-Swami Shantanand Saraswati was entitled to have thebenefit of judgment of Trial Court.(5) Aforesaid judgment operates as res judicata and issue of validity of installation of Swami KrishnaBodhashram in the office of Shankaracharya cannot be agitated by plaintiff in this case.(6) Since installation of Swami Krishna Bodhashram was invalid, no vacancy occurred on his deathon 10.09.1973. That being so, alleged installation of Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati in the office ofShankaracharya is also invalid and has no legal consequence.(7) After resignation of Swami Shantanand Saraswati, Swami Vishnu Deva Nand Saraswati wasinstalled and after renunciation of office of Shankaracharya due to death of Swami Vishnu DevaNand Saraswati, Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati was installed in the office of Shankaracharya on14/15.11.1989.(8) In order to be a valid appointment/ installation of Shankaracharya, one must possess requisitequalifications/eligibility as provided in Mathamanya/ Mahanushasan, which includes:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/322(i) should be a Dandi Sanyasi;(ii) must have good knowledge of Sanskrit;(iii) well conversant in Vedas, Upnishads, Brahmanas, Puranas, Vedangas etc.; and,(iv) must be a Brahmin.(9) Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati never attained Sanyashood and never lived life of a Sanyasi,since he continued in service of an educational institution receiving grant-in-aid from StateGovernment and salary to Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati was paid by State Government till13.11.1989, he was disqualified to be appointed as Shankaracharya, and, therefore, his installation asShankaracharya is illegal, invalid and confers no right to hold or function as Sankaracharya.(10) The words and title "Jagadguru Shankaracharya" have received a specific significance,importance and status amongst Hindus following Sanatan Dharma. There are only four Mathspropounded by Adi Shankaracharya namely, Jyotirmath near Badrika Ashram, (Badri Nath in PauriGarhwal) (Now Chamoli Garhwal) in the North; Sharda Math in West (Gujarat); Shringeri Math inMysore (South) and Goverdhan Math at Puri (East), hence no other person is entitled to use theaforesaid designation, title, distinctions etc and such use by any other person is wholly unauthorizedand nothing but a fraud upon the religious minded people following Sanatan Dharma.(11) Government should take appropriate steps to identify such persons, who use such title ordesignation unauthorizedly, and are claiming and running such Ashrams etc. as self acclaimedreligious Heads and conferring titles upon themselves on their own as Priest, Mahant or Head ofMath etc., other than four Maths established by Adi Shankaracharya, noted above.(12) The respective Governments and/or the Shankarachayas and other highly placed Sanyasis,Mahants of other Religious Endowments etc. should evolve an in-house procedure for suchidentification and to prepare a complete inventory of properties possessed by every Math orreligious endowment etc.; income of each such religious endowments should be well audited andthere should be proper system of change of reign so that these highly placed religious endowmentsetc. are protected from frequent litigation.(13) The impugned judgment and decree in appeal shall stand modified in respect of its findings onissues which are reversed hereinabove. However, injunction granted by Court below restrainingappellant from discharging functions as Shankaracharya is hereby confirmed. But, since now avacancy has arisen in the office of Shankaracharya at Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, same shall be filledin by following the same procedure as was done in 1941 when office of Shankaracharya inJyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth was in oblivion for last 165 years and unoccupied. This exercise, we hopeand trust, shall be completed by all concerned within three months. Till new Shankaracharya isinstalled at Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth, parties shall maintain status quo as on date.Result:Swami Vasudevanand Saraswati ... vs Jagat Guru Shankarcharya ... on 22 September, 2017Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/37475462/323746. Appeal is partly allowed. Impugned judgment of Trial Court in respect of issues we haverecorded our findings otherwise is hereby set aside and substituted by our findings. We howeveruphold injunction granted against appellant restraining him from discharging functions asShankaracharya. We further make it clear that this injunction shall not be construed so as toauthorize plaintiff to function as Shankaracharya of Jyotirmath and Jyotishpeeth since he was nevervalidly installed in the said position/status. B.D.M. VNS, learned Pandits, scholars andShankaracharyas of other three Peethas are directed to proceed and follow the same procedure aswas adopted in 1941, to select a suitable, eligible and qualified person for installation asShankaracharya in Jyotirmath/Jyotishpeeth and complete this process within three months.747. In view of divided success we permit the parties to bear their own costs.748.
