It is pertinent to mention here that CBI Vs. AkhandPratap Singh & Ors.it was a voluminous case running into thousand of pages, hundred of witnesses and number ofaccused persons. Sh. V. Madhukar, Ld. counsel for A1 being conscious of the fact that after amarathon hearing, the case having been fixed for orders on charge, confined his arguments andinvited the attention of the court primarily on the limited points. 3.2 Sh.

Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/13dated 05/12/09 as well the written submissions filed by A1 during the earlier course of hearing. Ld.counsel for A1 also placed on record written submissions dated 30.07.2014 and also filed additionalwritten submissions on the same day.3.3 Sh. ID Vaid, Ld. Spl. PP for CBI reiterated that the view taken by this court earlier was correctview and there is no reason to change the same.3.4 Before going to the factual matrix of the present case, it's relevant to mention that ConstitutionBench (Five Judges) of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dr. Subramanian Swamy Vs. Director, CentralBureau of Investigation & Anr. Writ Petition (Civil) No.38 of 1997 recently on CBI Vs. AkhandPratap Singh & Ors.06.05.2014 inter alia held that Section 6A(1), which requires approval of the Central Government toconduct any inquiry or investigation into any offence alleged to have been committed under the PCAct, 1988 where such allegation relates to (a) the employees of the Central Government of the levelof Joint Secretary and above and (b) such officers as are appointed by the Central Government incorporations established by or under any Central Act, government companies, societies and localauthorities owned or controlled by the Government, is invalid and violative of Article 14 of theConstitution. The Hon'ble Supreme Court directed that as a necessary corollary, the provisioncontained in Section 26(c) of the Act 45 of 2003 to that extent is also declared invalid.It is pertinent to mention here that the Apex Court in para 90 also observed that insofar asinvestigation is concerned, an investigation into a crime may have some adverse impact but wherethere are allegations of an offence under the PC Act, 1988 against a public servant, whether high orimportance and unearthing the truth is the goal. The aim and object of investigation is ultimately tosearch for truth and any law that impedes that object may not stand the test of Article 14.This court has the privilege of taking the guidance of philosophy being propounded and developedby the Apex court of this land CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.in various landmark judgments delivered from time to time in respect of the law relating toprevention of corruption.3.5 The order dated 18.07.2013 has not been reproduced herein for the sake of brevity. However, itwould be advantageous to reproduce the questions framed by this court while deciding the issue ofsanction, which are as under :1. whether appellant is the employee of Central Govt. in the level of Joint Secretaryrequiring prior permission u/S.6A of DSPE Act ;2. whether appellant is right in contending that investigation against the appellant isvitiated in view of violation of mandatory provisions of S.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/146A of DSPE Act.In regard to the issue No.1, whether the accused was Joint Secretary or not at the relevant time, thiscourt at page No.24 held that A1 Akhand Pratap Singh was an IAS officer allotted to the State cadreof UP and there is no material on the record even to assume that accused was in the Central Govt. ata senior position i.e. at the level of decision making and therefore, in absence of any such material,the accused cannot claim protection u/S.6A of DSPE Act.While replying question No.1, this court had mentioned that CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.there was nothing on the record to suggest that accused was an employee of Central Government ata senior position i.e. at the level of decision making at any point of time. This observation of thecourt has come under severe challenge by the defence. The defence has assailed this finding beforethe Hon'ble High Court and placed several documents, which are part of the chargesheet itself, toshow that A1 Akhand Pratap Singh was Joint Secretary in the Government of India, somewherefrom 1991 to 1994. These documents were highlighted during the course of arguments, while thematter was being heard after being remanded back by the Hon'ble High Court. It is correct thatthese documents do reflect that A1 Akhand Pratap Singh was Joint Secretary in Government ofIndia from May 1991 to July 1994. It is also pertinent to mention here that the finding regardingquestion no.1 was given by the court primarily relying upon the judgment in Pramod Kumar Vs.UOI, WA No.12 of 2013 decided on 29.04.2013 by the Hon'ble High Court of Madras. Even at thecost of brevity the analysis of Pramod Kumar's case as made by this court in para 3.1.1 at page No.19is reproduced as below :"CBI would submit that in Pramod Kumar's case (supra), the question raised aswhether the appellant / Insp. General of Police, IPS Officer allotted to Tamil NaduCadre is an employee of Central Govt. and level of Joint Secretary, covered by S.6A ofalia, framed the following questions :CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.1. whether appellant is the employee of Central Govt. in the level of Joint Secretaryrequiring prior permission u/S.6A of DSPE Act ;2. whether appellant is right in contending that investigation against the appellant isvitiated in view of violation of mandatory provisions of S.6A of DSPE Act.Hon'ble High Court took into account relevant rules governing service conditions andArticle 312 of the Constitution of India which provides for creation of All Indiaconnection with the affairs of the State of Tamil Nadu, the State Govt. shall be theappropriate Government in respect of such employee for all practicable purpose. Itwas noted that All India Service officers are only recruited by Union Public ServiceCbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/15Commission, a constitutional body for being borne on several States of the Union. NoAll India Service Officer is recruited to serve the Central Govt., except on deputationto Central Govt. Central Govt. makes rules with regard to All India Service Officersonly to have uniformity in service conditions for such officers. The court negated thecontention of the appellant that he is an employee of the Central Govt. while borne onState cadre. It was further held that therefore, prior approval u/S.6A is not required,and both the questions were replied against the petitioner."In absence of anything to contrary, this judgment having not been interfered by theApex Court, it stands as a good Law.3.6 It is also advantageous to reproduce section 6A of the DSPE Act, which reads as under :"6A. Approval of Central Government to conduct inquiry or investigation - (1) TheDelhi Special Police Establishment shall not conduct any inquiry or investigation intoany offence alleged to have been committed under the Prevention of Corruption Act,1988 except with the previous approval of the Central Government where such CBIVs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.(a) the employees of the Central Government of the Level of Joint Secretary andabove ; and(b) such officers as are appointed by the Central Government in corporationsestablished by or under any Central Act, Government companies, societies and localauthorities owned or controlled by that Government.necessary for cases involving arrest of a person on the spot on the charge of acceptingor attempting to accept any gratification other than legal remuneration referred to inclause (c) of the Explanation to section 7 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988."3.7 Bare perusal of this provision would make it clear that the approval of Central Governmentu/S.6A would have been necessary had the accused was Joint Secretary at the time of registration ofFIR or i.e. initiation of inquiry or investigation. If the accused had been Joint Secretary at earlierpoint of time i.e. in the present case around 10 years before the initiation of inquiry or investigation,the protection as awarded u/S.6A would not be available to him. Even though, Section 6A has nowbecome history in view of the judgment of Hon'ble Supreme Court in Dr. Subramanian Swamy Vs.Director, Central Bureau of Investigation & Anr., Writ Petition (Civil) No. 38 of 1997, yet it isreaffirmed that this protection cannot be extended to an accused who has remained Joint Secretaryfor a fraction of period for which CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/16the FIR/RC is lodged. The purpose of S.6A seems to be that before initiation of inquiry orinvestigation, the approval is required if at that relevant time, the accused was Joint Secretary inCentral Government. 3.8 Now coming to the second question. This court had formulated in clearterms the following observations :"The above said discussion makes it clear that if a consent has been refused duringthe service tenure of a public servant, CBI cannot register the FIR and conduct theinvestigation after superannuation unless and until eithera) earlier order regarding refusal has been reviewed on the basis of fresh material or,b) the CBI has got the consent of the State Govt. subsequently or,c) the CBI has registered the FIR and conducted the investigation on the facts whichwere not the directly and substantially the same or the subject matter of earlier movefor consent."Similarly, it was concluded as under :1. A1 Akhand Pratap Singh is not entitled for protection u/S.6A of DSPE Act, becausehe did not fall within the ambit of provision of S.6A of DSPE Act ;2. The refusal of consent by State Govt. in the year 2003 was not a hurdle for the CBIfor registering case against the accused in 2005, as there is nothing on the record tosuggest that consent was refused by the State Govt. on the set of facts / materialwhich were directly and substantially the same on which RC No. 2(A)/05 wasregistered ; and3. CBI was not required to take fresh consent before the registration of RCNo.2(A)/05 as by that time A1 Akhand Pratap Singh superannuated and ceased to bea public servant.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.3.9 Sh. V. Madhukar, Ld. counsel for A1 has strenuously argued that this finding is required to bereconsidered in view of the fact that earlier complaints made by Dr. Baliram, the then MP, and Sh.present RC was registered. A1 Akhand Pratap Singh in all fairness also placed on record the copy ofcomplaint made by Dr. Baliram and Sh. Satyadeo Tripathi. The comments made by A1 in regard tocomplaint of Dr. Baliram has also been placed on record.I have gone through the complaints and comments made by A1 Akhand Pratap Singh. I considerthat even this would not help the accused in any manner. The allegations made by Dr. Baliram in hiscomplaint sent to Hon'ble Governor, UP alongwith his letter dated 16.07.1996 were on the followingCbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/17points :1) Land Scandals of Lucknow Development Authority During the Posting As ViceChairman, LDA2) Misuse of Office As Secretary - Housing, Govt. of UP3) Halwasia Scandal4) Misdeeds Done As Director Handlooms5) Benami Venus Cement Factory in Dehradoon6) Benami Sugar Factory in Distt.

Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/18CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.3.10 Bare perusal of these complaints and the comments offered by A1 Akhand Pratap Singh wouldmake it clear that some of the allegations made in these complaints and RCchargesheet is much beyond and wider than the allegations made by Sh. Satyadeo Tripathi and Dr.Baliram. Therefore, it cannot be said that State Government had refused the consent on all theallegations which are subject matter of the present RC against Akhand Pratap Singh and others. Ihave considered the issue raised by the Ld. counsel for A1 Akhand Pratap Singh regarding sanctionu/S 6 and approval u/S 6A of DSPE Act, 1946 and of the considered view that accused (A1) cannothave the protection of Section 6 and Section 6A of DSPE Act, 1946.4.0 Before proceeding further, it is pertinent to mention the ingredients of S.13(1)(e) of POC Act,1988 which are as under :(i) accused is a government servant;(ii) nature and extent of the pecuniary resources or property which were found in hispossession;(iii)what were the known sources of income of the accused i.e., known to CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.the prosecution; and,(iv) the prosecution must prove quite objectively that such resources or property found inpossession of the accused were disproportionate to his known sources of income.If the prosecution succeeds in establishing the above said four ingredients, the offence u/S 13(1)(e)of the PC Act is complete if the accused is unable to account for such resources or property.Reference can be made to State of Maharashtra Vs. Wasudeo Ramachandra Kaidalwar AIR 1981 SC1186 and M. Krishna Reddy Vs. State Deputy Superintendent of Police, Hyderabad, AIR 1993 SC313.The offence of disproportionate assets defined in Sec. 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, iscommitted when a public servant possesses pecuniary resources or property disproportionate to hisknown sources of income. In C.S.D Swami Vs. State, AIR 1960 SC 7, the Hon'ble Supreme Courtheld that the expression "known sources of income" must have reference to sources known to theprosecution on a thorough investigation of the case. It was not, and it could not be, contended that"known sources of income" means sources known to the accused. It is pertinent to mention here thatthe explanation to Sec. 13 (1)(e) was added CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.only in the year 1988 which reads as under:Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/19income received from any lawful source and such receipt has been intimated inaccordance with the provisions of any law, rules or orders for the time beingapplicable to a public servant."Thus, it is seen that, now for a source of income to qualify as a known sources ofincome for the purposes of Sec. 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, it(i) it should be a lawful source of income, and(ii)the receipt of income from such a source should have been intimated inaccordance with the provisions of any law, rules or orders for the time beingapplicable to the concerned public servant.(a) any income received from a source which is not lawful cannot be considered for inclusion in theexpression known sources of income for the purposes of Sec. 13(1)(e) of the said Act, even if such anincome was actually received by the concerned public servant;(b) any income, even though received from a lawful source, cannot likewise be considered forinclusion in the expression known sources of income for the aforesaid purposes, if the receipt ofsuch income has not been intimated in accordance with the provisions of any law, rules or orders forthe time being applicable to the concerned public servant.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.In N. Ramakrishnaiah Vs. State of AP, 2009 CriLJ 1767, also it was held as under:"Section 13 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (in short the 'Act') deals withvarious situations when a public servant can be said to have committed criminalservant or any person on his behalf, is in possession or has, at any time during theperiod of his office, been in possession for which the public servant cannotsatisfactorily account of pecuniary resources of property disproportionate to hisin similar lines. But there have been drastic amendments. Under the new clause, theearlier concept of "known sources of income" has undergone a radical change. As perthe explanation appended, the prosecution is relieved of the burden of investigatinginto "source of income" of an accused to a large extent, as it is stated in theexplanation that "known sources of income" mean income received from any lawfulsources, the receipt of which has been intimated in accordance with the provisions ofany law, rules or orders for the time being applicable to a public servant. TheCbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/20expression "known source of income" has reference to sources known to theprosecution after thorough investigation of the case. It is not, and cannot becontended that "known sources of income" means sources known to the accused. Theprosecution cannot, in the very nature of things be expected to know the affairs of anaccused person. Those will be matters "specially within the knowledge" of theaccused, within the meaning of Section 106, of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (inshort, the 'Evidence Act').The emphasis of the phrase "known sources of income" in Section 13(1)(e) (old Section 5(1)(e)) is clearly on the word "income". It would be primary toobserve that qua the public servant, the income would be what is attached to hisoffice or post, commonly known as remuneration or salary. The term "income" byitself, is classic and has a wide connotation. Whatever comes in or is received isincome. But, however, wide the import and connotation of the term "income", it isincapable of CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.being understood as meaning receipt having no nexus to one's labour, or expertise, orproperty, or investment, and being further a source which may or may not yield aregular revenue. These essential characteristics are vital in understanding the term"Income". Therefore, it can be said that, though "income" in receipt in the hand of itsrecipient, every receipt would not partake into the character of income. For the publicservant, whatever return he gets of his service, will be the primary item of his income.Other income which can conceivably be income qua the public servant will be in theregular receipt from (a) his property, or (b) his investment. A receipt from windfall,or gains of graft crime or immoral secretions by persons prima facie would not bereceipt for the "known source of income" of a public servant.The legislature has advisedly used the expression "satisfactorily account". Theemphasis must be on the word "satisfactorily" and the legislature has, thus,deliberately cast a burden on the accused not only to offer a plausible explanation asto how he came by his large wealth, but also to satisfy the Court that his explanationwas worthy of acceptance."In this case, the interpretation of Section 109 IPC is also quite important.The ingredients of S.109IPC is as under :(a) there must be abetment of an offence,(b) the act abetted must have been committed in consequence of the abetment, and,(c) there must be no express provision, made in this Code, for the punishment of such abetment.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/215.0 Before coming to the factual matrix of the case, I consider that CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh &Ors.there is a material legal question which needs to be answered : (1) What is the scope of jurisdictionfor framing the charge u/S 228 Cr.PC?(1) What is the scope of jurisdiction for framing the charge u/S 228 Cr.PC?There are catena of judgments laying down the principles to be followed at the stage ofconsideration of charge. It has been consistently held that at this stage, the Court has only toconsider the prima facie case to see that whether there is sufficient ground for proceeding againstthe accused. The prosecution as well as the defence have cited number of judgments on this point. Iconsider that reproduction of those judgments would only add to the volume of the case.I have gone through the judgments cited by the parties and I consider that in Union of India Vs.Prafulla Kumar Samal & Anr., AIR 1979 SC 366, the law lays down in detail the jurisdiction to beexercised at the stage of charge. The principles laid down in this case can be reproduced as follows :"Thus, on a consideration of the authorities mentioned above, the followingprinciples emerge:(1) That the Judge while considering the question of framing the charges CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.under section 227 of the Code has the undoubted power to sift and weigh theevidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie caseagainst the accused has been made out:(2) Where the materials placed before the Court disclose grave suspicion against theaccused which has not been properly explained the Court will be, fully justified inframing a charge and proceeding with the trial. (3) The test to determine a primafacie case would naturally depend upon the facts of each case and it is difficult to laydown a rule of universal application. By and large however if two views are equallypossible and the Judge is satisfied that the evidence produced before him while givingrise to some suspicion but not grave suspicion against the accused, he will be fullywithin his right to discharge the accused.(4) That in exercising his jurisdiction under section 227 of the Code the Judge whichunder the present Code is a senior and experienced Judge cannot act merely as a Postprobabilities of the case, the total effect of the evidence and the documents producedbefore the Court, any basic infirmities appearing in the case and so on. This howeverdoes not mean that the Judge should make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons ofthe matter and weigh the evidence as if he was conducting a trial."Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/22In Jitendra Bhimraj Bijje and others v. State of Maharashtra, AIR 1990 SC 1962, it was inter aliaheld as under:charge, the Court is required to evaluate the material and documents on record with aview to finding out if the facts emerging therefrom taken at their face value disclosethe existence of all the ingredients constituting the alleged offence. The Court may forthis limited purpose sift the evidence as it cannot be expected even at that initialstage to accept all that the prosecution states as gospel truth even if it is opposed tocommon sense or the broad probabilities of the case."CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.In Sudhir Kumar Jain v. State, (Delhi), 1994(3) R.C.R.(Criminal) 42, it was inter alia held as under:"An accused is to be discharged under section 239 of the Code of Criminal Procedureonly if the Magistrate considers the charge against him to be groundless. The word"groundless" connotes absence of any ground for presuming that the accused hascommitted an offence. It would mean a case where the materials collected by theinvestigating agency are found to be not even remotely sufficient to raise strongsuspicion against the accused. The Apex Court in C.S. & Mfg. Co. v. State ofMaharashtra, AIR 1972 S.C. 545 held that when the provision says that the chargesmust be considered to be groundless, it means "the same thing as saying that there isno ground for framing the charges'. Section 239 of the Code has to be read alongwithSection 240 of the Code according to which, it after considering the documents andhearing the accused the Magistrate thinks that there is ground for presuming that theaccused has committed an offence triable as a warrant case which he is competent totry and adequately punish, he has to frame in writing a charge against the accused.Surely at the stage envisaged by Sections 239 and 240 of the Code the Court has toapply its judicial mind for considering whether or not there in a ground forpresuming the commission of the offence by the accused. It cannot and must notblindly adopt what the prosecution claims. However, at the same time while lookinginto the matter the court is not to apply the standard of test and judgment which is tobe finally applied before recording a finding of guilt or otherwise. At the stage ofsections 239 and 240 of the Code if there is a strong suspicion which makes the courtthink that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence,the court would not be justified in saying that there was no sufficient ground forproceeding against the accused. This being the law can it be said that the learned trialMagistrate has violated it ? The answer, to my mind, must be in the negative."CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/23In State of Orissa v. Debendra Nath Padhi, AIR 2005 SC 359, it was inter alia held asunder:"The expression "the record of the case" is used in S. 227 of the Code. Though theword "case" is not defined in the Code but S. 209 throws light on the interpretation tobe placed on the word. Section 209 which deals with the commitment of case to Courtof Session when offence is triable exclusively by it, inter alia, provides that when itappears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by the Court ofSession, he shall commit "the case" to the Court of Session and send to that Court"the record of the case" and the document and articles, if any, which are to beproduced in evidence and notify the Public Prosecutor of the commitment of the caseto the Court of Session. It is evident that the record of the case and documentssubmitted therewith as postulated in S. 227 relate to the case and the documentsreferred in S. 209. That is the plain meaning of S. 227 read with S. 209 of the Code.No provision in the Code grants to the accused any right to file any material ordocument at the stage of framing of charge. That right is granted only at the stage ofthe trial. The material as produced by the prosecution alone is to be considered andnot the one produced by the accused. (Paras 8,16) Contention of accused that the procedure which deprives the accused to seekdischarge at the initial stage by filing unimpeachable and unassailable material ofsterling quality would be illegal and violative of Arts. 21 and 24 of the Constitutioncannot be accepted. The reliance on Arts. 14 and 21 is misplaced. At the stage offraming of charge roving and fishing inquiry is impermissible. If the contention of theaccused is accepted, there would be a mini trial at the stage of framing of charge. Thatwould defeat the object of the Code. It is well settled that at the stage of framing ofcharge the defence of the accused cannot be put forth. The acceptance of thecontention of the accused would mean permitting the accused to adduce his defenceat the stage of framing of charge and for examination thereof at that stage which isagainst the criminal jurisprudence. That has never been the intention of the law wellsettled for over one hundred years now. It is in this light that the provision abouthearing the submissions of the accused as postulated by CBI Vs. Akhand PratapSingh & Ors.S. 227 is to be understood. It only means hearing the submission of the accused onthe record of the case as filed by the prosecution and documents submitted therewithand nothing more. The expression "hearing the submissions of the accused" cannotmean opportunity to file material to be granted to the accused and thereby changingthe settled law. At the stage of framing of charge hearing the submissions of theaccused has to be confined to the material produced by the police.Omission to frame charge."Machra In Smarty v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi), 2007 CRI.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/24L. J. 4341, it was inter alia held as under:"...it is well-settled that the considerations which are relevant at the time of framingof charges and those at the time of conclusion of the trial are entirely different. Whilegrave suspicion would entitle a Court to frame charges, grave suspicion alone wouldnot entitle the Court to convict a person in respect of the said charges. At the time offraming of charges all that is necessary to see is that on the basis of the documentsproduced by the prosecution whether a grave suspicion arises with regard to thecommission of the crime. The suspicion may be dispelled entirely in the course of thetrial because of lack of evidence or for other reasons, but if the Court has strongreasons to suspect that the crime was committed by the accused, then it would not bein error if it frames charges accordingly."In Hem Chand v. State of Jharkhand, AIR 2008 SC 1903, it was inter alia held that:"The Court at the stage of framing charge exercises a limited jurisdiction. It wouldonly have to see as to whether a prima facie case has been made out. Whether a caseof probable conviction for commission of an offence has been made out on the basisof the CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.materials found during investigation should be the concern of the Court. It, at thatstage, would not delve deep into the matter for the purpose of appreciation ofevidence, It would ordinarily not consider as to whether the accused would be able toestablish his defence, if any, The stage for appreciating the evidence for the purposeof arriving at a conclusion as to whether the prosecution was able to bring home thecharge against the accused or not would arise only after all the evidences are broughton records at the trial. The refusal by Court to look into documents filed by theaccused along with his application for discharge is proper."In State of Tamil Nadu Vs. Insp. of Police Vigilance and Anti Corruption Vs. N.Hon'ble Supreme Court inter alia held that:"At this stage, probative value of the materials has to be gone into and the court is notexpected to go deep into hte matter and hold that the materials would not warrant aconviction. In our opinion, what needs to be considered is whether there isa groundfor presuming that the offence has been committed and not whether a ground forconvicting the accused has been made out. To put it differently, if the Court thinksthat the accused might have committed the offence on the basis of the materials onrecord on its probative value, it can frame the charge; though for conviction, the courthas to come to the conclusion that the accused has committed the offence. The lawdoes not permit a mini trial at this stage."There cannot be any doubt to the proposition emphasized by Ld.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/25Counsel for the accused that the court cannot be a mouthpiece of the prosecution andsince the order framing the charge specifically effects a person's liberty, the court maynot automatically frame the charge. Similarly, CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.the court is conscious of the fact that if two view are possible and evidence gives rise to somesuspicion but not grave suspicion, accused can be discharged. Reliance placed on Dilawar BabuKurane Vs. State of Maharashtra, (2002) 2 SCC 135.ARGUMENTS BY DEFENCE 6.0 Sh. V. Madhukar, Ld. counsel for A1 has submitted that accusedpersons are entitled to be discharged on the ground that the present prosecution is nothing but asterling example of vindictiveness witch hunting and malafide. A1 having been already retired andceases to be a public servant the proceedings under POC Act could not have been instituted againsthim. In support of his contention, Ld. counsel has cited State of West Bengal Vs. Syamadas Bannerji& Anr. (2008) 9 SC 45 and Jastinder Singh vs State 2001 CrLJ 11. It has further been submitted thatin every case under POC Act and moreso, in a case prosecuted by CBI, a preliminary inquiry beforeregistration of the case is desirable. It becomes mandatory and essential in a case of "misconduct"u/S.13(1)(e) of the act by virtue of very ingredients of the offence and by virtue of its definition.Reliance has been placed upon State Inspector of Police Vs. Surya Sankaran KarriMANU/SC/8438/2006. In Surya Sanskari case (supra), the CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Apex court has inter alia held that the least a court of law can expect from the prosecution is that theinvestigation would be a fair one. Similarly, in State of Haryana Vs. Bhajan Lal, 1992 Supp (1) SCC335, it was inter alia held that it is failure to satisfactorily account for such possession of pecuniaryresources or property which is disproportionate to the known sources of income that isobjectionable. It was also held that if the accused had never been asked to account, the conclusionwas impossible. Ld. counsel submitted that it is mandatory requirement that accused must be askedto give his explanation at a stage prior to registration of the case. Reliance has also been placed uponP. Sirajuddin Vs. State of Madras, AIR 1971 SC 520, wherein also it was inter alia held that theremust be some suitable preliminary inquiry into allegations by a responsible officer before FIR islodged against the public servant. Sh. V. Madhukar, Ld. counsel stated that the Apex Court in AshokTshering Bhutia Vs. State of Sikkim, (2011) 4 SCC 402 again made a very strong remark regardingholding of preliminary inquiry before a public servant is charged with an act of dishonesty. The Apexcourt directed that there must be some suitable preliminary inquiry by a responsible officer. It wasalso inter alia held that non holding of such inquiry would be an irregularity which is not curable norwould it fall within the ambit of 465 Cr.P.C. It was submitted that it is a trite law that in a given CBIVs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.case, the accused may have the opportunity to 'satisfactorily account' for alleged submission of theaccused that an abject failure to even initiate this exercise on the part of IO will nullify theproceedings. In the present case, there is not even a pretense, or even a flimsy claim of a PE and FIRwas registered only on source information. CBI also changed the check period unilaterally from 1978to 1991 to 01.04.82 to 31.03.98. The check period was changed only while finalizing the chargesheetand therefore, the accused who had been afforded no opportunity to render the explanationregarding the assets, became part of the case as a result of change in check period. The defence hasCbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/26pleaded that change of the check period has caused serious prejudice to the accused and it amountsto shifting the goal post during the game. The prosecution has no justification to change the checkperiod. The prosecution has conducted the investigation malafidely and even resorted to commitfraud against the Court in order to mislead the court. The defence has alleged that there is solidevidence to indicate the misconduct of the Predecessor IO who is no longer part of the CBI. Ld.Defence Counsel pointed out that the original reference letter sent to GEQD was fabricated. Certainparas were deleted making reference to Q.163 to 176. The investigating agency also fabricatedstatement of LW21 Satish Kumar u/S.161 Cr.P.C. It was pointed out that one statement recorded inHindi having signature of IO dated 23.11.07 has been made part of the case diary.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.However, another statement of the same witness in English alleged to have been recorded on thesame date and signed by the same IO has been filed in the court. The second statement filed in thecourt has made material alterations in the contents of the statement and also reference to the nameof A1 at twelve places whereas they did not exist in the original statement. Ld. Defence counselalleged that the CBI has also tampered with the chargesheet, the contents of which have beendeleted/added without any direction or permission of the court. IO has on his own withdrawn orwithheld some documents like D210, D299 etc. Similarly some other documents and seizure memosthough withdrawn by the IO have been resubmitted by his successors, five years later on 19.05.2012as additional and renumbered documents as the successor did not want to become a part of cover upexercise. Similarly, the seizure memos dated 27.04.2007, 26.06.2007, 01.10.2007 and 08.10.2007(D427 to D430) were withdrawn and reintroduced with new number. The documents werereintroduced only when the defence proved that they already held a hard copy supplied to them atan earlier stage. It was alleged that CBI added a large number of documents and surreptitiouslyintroduced the original suppressed record with a malafide intention. Ld. Defence counsel submittedthat there were no compliance with the mandate of Section 102 Cr.P.C. The defence submitted thatthe act and lapses of CBI would not stop at malice, as these are specific instances of CBI Vs. AkhandPratap Singh & Ors.deliberate frauds and misuse of authority which necessitated intervention and protection of thecourt.Further proceeding, A1 has given an explanation to all the items of the assets at the end of the checkperiod as enumerated in the chargesheet. Ld. counsel for the accused has filed a detailed writtenarguments after a marathon session of oral arguments being advanced by him.

UP Singh.The plea of the defence is that this construction was for the family and was planned as family assets.A1 had no say or share in operations. Even in his registered Will dated 17.08.91 late Sh. UP Singhbequeathed his entire agricultural land in Distt. Bahraich and Faizabad and his house in BaharaichCBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.to his younger son Ramesh Pratap Singh and nothing to A1 AP Singh. The defence submitted thatthe case of the prosecution is that A1 is the benami owner of several assets of Late Sh. UP Singh andtherefore, status of Late Sh. UP Singh is necessary to determine in order to assess whether the assetsacquired by Late Sh. UP Singh were his own. It was stated that Late Sh. UP Singh was in UP Stateemployed in Acharya Narendra Deo Agriculture University, Faizabad few kilometers from hisancestral home, for four years. Then he finally retired and settled down in his village home inChandanpur, Behraich. Late Sh. UP Singh had an ancestral house in Khajurahat Distt. Faizabad inLucknow.

The plea of the defence is that this account No.843 was opened inIn respect of allegations of the prosecution that A1 has signed as UP Singh on the account openingform as well as the cheque issued from bank, the plea of the defence is that such allegations eventhough supported by the CFSL may not make the account benami and A1 guilty of forging thesignatures of Late Sh. UP Singh. Ld. Counsel for A1 submitted that his client has not put any fund inthe account. The account does not have a single cash deposit and all the receipts are clearlyaccounted. The funds were released during the entire lifetime of Sh. UP Singh to pay for obligationsentered into by him only. The account was closely connected with his other accounts and businessoperation. Ld. Counsel submitted that there is a valid explanation for increasing disability of late Sh.Cbi vs .

The defence hasrelied upon certain transactions made between this account to the account of IOB, Lucknow andspecifically transaction dtd. 24/8/93 of Rs. 1 lakhs. The defence has pleaded that there was nodeposit by cash and all the transactions were clearly accounted for, therefore, the opening andoperation of Karur Vyasa Bank account would not come in the ambit of "false document" ordishonestly or fraudulently. There was no effort to avoid taxation and complete disclosure was maderegarding all the transactions. The payments received after the death of Sh. UP Singh were alsodistributed to several beneficiaries. A1 has submitted that he merely allowed the cheques issuedduring the lifetime of his father to be encashed and by doing so, cannot be said to have committedany fraud. He was merely implementing the wishes CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.of his father as understood by him. Ld. Counsel for A1 has submitted that Late Sh. UP Singh hadworked in the government for around 34 years as a senior officer but CBI did not place any record ofhis earnings, assets or retirement benefits. The ITR of Late Sh.

Late Sh. Govind Mishra entered intoa lease deed with LDA on 3/5/86 and possession was duly handed over on 3/6/86. Late Sh. GovindMishra was unfortunately murdered on 31/8/96, however, he left a Will dtd. 14/1/93, copy of whichis at page 39 D22. By virtue of this Will, Late Sh. Govind Mishra left this property in favour of A3.The Will was sent to GEQD which returned a Nil finding on Q.700, Q700A and Q701 (D304, page6). Ld. Counsel submitted that there is no evidence to show that this Will was a forged document. Inabsence of any positive evidence, CBI cannot rely upon the testimony of Sh. Uday Mishra PW19 andSh. Shriram PW19 (purported witness to Will dtd. 14/1/93). Ld. Counsel submitted that PW18 CBIVs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.has not challenged this Will till date. Ld.

None of these witnesses attribute any criminality or role to A3 apart fromthe recorded fact that A3 was a transferee of the property. It has further been submitted that therewas no role of A3 in the acquisition of plot by Late Sh. Govind Mishra in April 1983. Further more,at that time A3 was a minor. It has further been submitted that Late Sh. Govind Mishra has dulyshown this property in his ITR as on 31/3/90 (D318 page 75). The plea of the accused is that there isno positive evidence to demonstrate that the alleged Will is a false document. There is no materialon record to show any active abetment or conspiracy with A1 or any other accused persons. CBI hasproceeded merely on the assumption that A3 being daughter of A1 should be chargesheeted. Thedecision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in State of Tamil Nadu by Inspt.

Flat No. 8, Poorvi Marg, Vasant Vihar NewDelhi:The case of the CBI is that this property was acquired by A1 and late Sh. UP Singh on 07/11/86. Inthe year 1986, A4 was only 14 years old and cannot have any knowledge relating to the acquisition ofproperty as CBI Vs.

It has been submitted that A4 got married in the year 1996 and has beenindependently earning since 1994. Perusal of this document would show that A4 became the ownerof the property by virtue of Registered Will dtd. 17/8/91 executed by Late Sh.

The title deeds of her property were also handed over by A10 to the IO. The will of Late Sh.Anil Kumar Singh was not sent to CFSL and therefore, the allegation of forgery is without basis.

All the payments were made through cheque from the personal account of A12APN Singh. It was pointed out that CBI even did not examine said Sh. SP Arya.Land purchased by A12 APN Singh:In respect of the land purchased by A12 APN Singh, the defence submitted that A12 purchased thisland from Sh. Shyam Bihari who acquired it in small parcels from several scheduled caste owners.A12 has substantial ancestral land holdings in Vill. Sonadeeh, Distt. Ballia. A12 took agriculture ashis career. He purchased and retained agricultural land in Tehsil Bakshi ka Talab primarily for thepurpose of business of floriculture and poultry related operations. It has been submitted that A3Juhie Singh who is his bhabhi and elder member of the family was the overall in charge andpromoter and had a role in selecting, negotiating and approving purchase of land. It has beensubmitted that A1 had no role except that he was only kept informed about the transactions.Account No. 562, IOB, Gomati Nagar, Lucknow:This account has been listed at item No. 20 of bank accounts in the chargesheet.

UP Singh inKarur Vysya Bank. The payment for land at Hardaurpur, Bakshi ka Talab was also made muchbefore receipt of this Rs. 3.49 lakhs from late Sh. UP Singh. 16.0 I have considered the submissionsof the parties. Since, the items involved in the present case are huge, number of accused persons iswise:Item No. 1 : 9.81 acres of agricultural land in villages Chandanapur Sikaria, Khaira and Arai khurdin Tehsil Mahsi, Distt. Bahraich, UP in the name of A.P.Singh; and, Item No. 2: 7.414 acres ofagricultural land in village Chandanapur Sikaria, Pargana Fakharpur, Tehsil Mahsi, Distt. Bahraich,U.P. acquired in the name of Juhie Singh These properties had admittedly been acquired prior tothe check period and, therefore, have not been added in the disproportionate assets of the accused.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.of Smt. Neelam Singh and Shri A.P.Singh.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/61The defence has taken the plea that this property cannot be added in the DA as the same wsasacquired through an auction of DDA on 14/7/78 i.e. prior to the check period. The property wasinitially acquired jointly in the name of Late Smt. Lalmani Devi , Late Sh. Ramesh Pratap Singh andMs. Neelam Singh and this transaction has duly been reflected in ITR. A2 had let out this propertyto A3 Juhie Singh and this was also reflected in the ITR. I consider that since this property wasacquired before the check period the same cannot be taken as DA of A1.Item No. 4: Plot No.1/9, Vishwas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow in the name of Shri Akhand PratapSingh and Plot Nos. 1/10 & 1/11 Vishwas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow in the name of Smt. JuhieSingh.In regard to plot No. 1/9, there cannot be any dispute, as it belongs to AP Singh HUF. It is pertinentto mention here that income of AP Singh HUF has also been taken into account by the CBI in thechargesheet and therefore, for the purpose of DA it has to be taken into account at this CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.stage.In regard to plot No. 1/10, the substance of the arguments raised by the CBI is that though plot wasacquired in the name of Late Sh. Govind Mishra, however, initial payment was made from A/c No.31138, which was though an account in the name of Late Sh. Govind Mishra but it was opened andoperated by A1. The case of the CBI is that A3 Juhie Singh inherited this plot by virtue of a Will andthe possession was also taken by Sh. MA Masood who was General Power of Attorney of A1 in manycases. The prosecution has relied upon the testimony of LW20 BC Bhavook and LW7 Jai Prakash tosay that account No. 31138 was opened and operated by A1. The witnesses in their statement havestated that at no point of time Late Sh. Govind Mishra visited the bank. The case of the CBI is thattransfer of property by virtue of Will shows a pattern which indicates prima facie evidence againstA1 and A3. I consider that in view of statement of LW20, LW7 and LW Uday Mishra S/o Late Sh.Govind Mishra, prima facie there is material to consider this property in DA.In regard to plot No. 1/11, the plea of the CBI is that A1 forged signature of Late Sh.UP Singh onapplication, affidavit and sale deeds. This property was purchased in the joint name of Late Sh,. UPSingh and A3 Juhie Singh from LW21 Satish Kumar Singh. There is a statement of LW21 SatishKumar regarding sale of this plot to A1. The prosecution has relied CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh &Ors.upon the testimony of LW237 and LW238 also. The payment of this plot was also made in strangemanner. Rs. 2 lakhs was paid from the account of Late Sh. UP Singh and Rs. 3.5 lakhs were paid tobuilder Ansals for flat No. 1215, 38 Nehru Place. I consider that there is prima facie material onrecord that A1 has forged the signature of Late Sh. UP Singh as reaffirmed by GEQD report in D303.It is also pertinent to mention here that this property was transferred in the name of Late Sh. UPSingh and Juhie Singh in the year 1996 and at that time Juhie Singh was around 30 years of age. Itbe also be noted that on this document A1 has found to have forged signature of Late Sh. UP Singh.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/62Thus, A3 Juhie Singh has actively aided and abetted A1 in acquiring this property. Therefore,property No. 1/11, Vishwaskhand, Gomti Nagar can also be safely taken into the DA.Item no. 5: Cost of the house constructed on plots 1/9, 1/10 and 1/11, Vishwas Khand, Gomti Nagar,Lucknow.In respect of item No. 5, CBI has relied upon the testimony of LW9 Rajeev Goel Architect, LW10Smt. Rekha Goel w/o Sh. Rajeev Goel and LW11 Raj Kumar Gupta, Registered Valuer and LW26Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal, LW27 Syed Ahmed, LW28 Jamna Prasad, LW29 Ram Asray and LW30Imran Ali as well as D19. Prosecution has also relied upon the testimony of LW251 PC Mehrotra. Allof these listed witnesses have made CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.consistent statement before the CBI that cost of the construction of H. No. 1/9, 1/10 and 1/11 hadbeen incurred by A1 Akhand Pratap Singh. Item No. 6: Cost of construction of Swimming PoolComplex alongwith platform, rooms, servant quarters etc., at Chandanapur Sikaria, Bahraich Theprosecution has relied upon LW 128 Santosh Patel. Sh. Santosh Patel was working as a Munshi atThehra Bazaar Farm House till 2000 and then he was sent to Bakshi ka Talab Farm House till 2002.In respect of item No. 6, CBI has relied upon the testimony of LW26. Sh. Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal inhis statement to CBI stated that in mid 1993, A1 AP Singh took him to his farm at Thehra BazaarBehraich where he had a house which A1 said belonged to his father. A1 told LW26 to preparedrawings for a swimming pool complex alongwith room and staff quarter at that place. LW26prepared drawings which were accepted by A1. LW26 stated that the construction of staff quarter,swimming pool complex alongwith platform, room, verandah, changing room etc was completed bymid 1995 with an approximate of Rs. 13 lakhs. It specifically came in his evidence that entire amountwas paid by AP Singh and he had not met Sh. Uday Pratp Singh at all,. I consider that in view of LW26 prima facie there is a case to include this property in DA.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Item No. 7.: 9.45 acres in Araji No.423, Village Bhirva, Pargana Fakharpur, Tehsil Kaisarganj,Distt.Bahraich, in the name of Smt.Neelam Singh W/o A.P.Singh.This property has been acquired in the name of Late Smt. Neelam Singh i.e wife of A1. Since the CBIhas taken the income of Neelam Singh into account, this property can also be prima facie taken intoaccount for the purpose of DA.Item No. 8: 2.023 hectares (4.9987645 acres) of agricultural land in the name of A.P.Singh in villageHathi Chak, Pargana Fakharpur, Tehsil Mahsi, Distt. Bahraich.The prosecution has relied upon the testimony of LW16 Pramod Kumar who has stated that as perrevenue record this land is in the name of A1. However, as per sale deed D339, Late Sh. UP Singhbought this land from Maiku as guardian of Late Sh. Ravi Singh (son of A1). The plea of the defenceis that A1 inherited this land after death of Ravi Singh on 19/1/98. Since this property was acquiredby A1 before the end of check period, therefore, this has to be considered as an asset of A1. Item No.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/639: Flat No.1511, Ansal Towers, 38 Nehru Place , New Delhi acquired in the name of A5 and latertransferred in the name of Shri U.P.Singh and subsequently in the name of A3 In regard to Flat No.1511, Ansal Towers, 38, Nehru Place, the CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.case of the CBI is that initially this flat was allotted to A5 KM Khandelwal on 07.09.88. Sh. KMSubsequently, A5 walked out and transferred the allotment to Late Sh.UP Singh by withdrawing hisname and the name of his sister Smt. Sushila Devi on 22.9.92. A5 KM Khandelwal requested foradding the name of Late Sh. UP Singh and Late Sh. Ravi Singh. Subsequently, on 8/11/94 onpurported request of Late Sh. UP Singh, the name of A3 Juhie Singh was added as owner of thisplot. The case of CBI is that this signature of UP Singh has been forged by A1 as per GEQD reportD303. It is pertinent to mention here that subsequently the property was sold by A3 Juhie Singhafter the expiry of the check period. It may be noted that the property was initially allotted to KMKhandelwal. There is nothing on the record to suggest that A1 had used his resources to acquire thisproperty for A5. Subsequently, again the property was transferred in the name of UP Singh and RaviSingh. At this stage also it is not the case of CBI that A1 had used his monetary resource. The onlyallegation against A1 is that he forged the signature of his father Late Sh. UP Singh for adding thename of A3 Juhie Singh, I consider that this can be a case of forgery against A1. However, on thisaccount DA cannot be attributed to A1 nor any criminality can be attributed to A5 KM Khandelwal.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Item No. 10: Plot No.1/15, Vishwas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow in the name of Juhie Singh (Inexchange of plot No.118/A, Vishwas Khand and cost of the house constructed on this plot. PrimarilyCBI has added this property in the DA of A1 on account of the fact that on one of the document D29(page 85 challan form) A1 has forged the signature of A3 Juhie Singh. I consider that merely onaccount of the fact that A1 has forged the signature of Juhie Singh on the challan form, the propertycannot be attributed to A1. However, A1 is liable to be charged and tried for such acts of forgery asper law. Though the ownership of plot No. 1/15 cannot be attributed to A1, however, there is astatement of LW26 Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal who has specifically stated that in January 1997 A1asked him to prepare sketch plan for construction of a house at 1/15, Vishwaskhand in the name ofA3 Juhie Singh. LW26 stated that he carried out the construction and at an approximate cost of Rs.11.5 lakhs and the entire amount was paid by A1. Therefore, the cost of construction in the amountof Rs. 11.5 lakhs is prima facie to be added in the DA.Item No. 11 : Plot No.2A, (Rishi Vasisht Cooperative Housing Society Ltd.) Saraswatipuram,Lucknow acquired in the name of U.P.Singh and later transferred in the name of A3; and, CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Item No. 35 : Plot No.2B, (Rishi Vasisht Cooperative Housing Society Ltd.)Saraswatipuram,Lucknow acquired in the name of Anil Kumar Singh and later transferred in the name of A10.Perusal of the record indicates that these plots were acquired jointly by Late Sh. UP and Late Sh. AKSingh . However, lateron, i.e., after expiry of the check period, A1 moved an application under forgedsignature of UP Singh for the division of these plots. The plea of the defence is that infact AK SinghCbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/64was the first owner and he had made the payment. The defence has also pleaded that the letter onwhich allegedly A1 has forged the signature was only regarding division of plot and has nothing todo with the acquisition of plots. It has also been pointed out that after the death of both the ownersi.e UP Singh and AK Singh, the properties were inherited by A3 Juhie Singh and A10 Abha Singh. Iconsider that simply because A1 had forged the signature on the application for division of plot, theDA cannot be attributed to him, however, A1 is liable to be charged and tried for the offence offorgery.Item No.12 : Flat No.1216, Ansal Towers, 38 Nehru Place , New Delhi acquired in the name of ShriU.P.Singh and later transferred in the name of Smt.Java Singh.Perusal of the record would indicate that an application was CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.of a property and on this flat No.1216, 38 Nehru Place was allotted. The case of the CBI is that as peralso forged signatures of UP Singh on other documents, at places Q183 to Q188, Q193, Q194, Q198,Q204, Q206 to Q223. These questioned signatures have been found to be of A1 as per GEQD reportRavi Singh. Subsequently the name of A4 Java Singh was added in the name of Ravi Singh. A4 JavaSingh sold this property to one Smt. Krishna Bansal after the expiry of check period. I consider thatsince this property was acquired by A1 by unfair means in the name of Late Sh. UP Singh therefore,prima facie this has to be added in the DA of A1. Later on this property was transferred in the nameof A4 Java Singh. Such transfer of property in the name of A4 Java Singh shows a pattern whichindicate that A4 Java Singh has actively aided and abated A1 in the acquisition of this property. A1seems to have evolved a novel method of getting the properties parked in the name of his daughtersi.e., A3 Juhie Singh and A4 Java Singh with their active aid.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Item No.13 : Flat No.8, Poorvi Apartments, Poorvi Marg, Vasant Vihar, New Delhi acquired in thename of Shri U.P.Singh and later transferred in the name of Smt.Java Singh.Perusal of the record would indicate that this plot was acquired in the name of Late Sh.UP Singh.For the purpose of transfer of this property on certain important documents in D35 (page 119, 143,141, 119, 94, 96 and98) A1 forged the signature of Late Sh. UP Singh. The plea of the CBI is that there is positive opinionof GEQD in D223 that A1 has forged the signature of Late Sh. UP Singh. The forgery of signature byA1 are on the important documents for the acquisition of the property, therefore, prima facie thisproperty is liable to be added in the DA. A1 is also liable to be charged for the offence of forgery onthis count.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/65Item No. 14. : Plot No. 7A K.No.29/12, Mehrauli, New Delhi acquired in the name of Smt. JavaSingh.Perusal of the record would indicate that as per testimony of LW38 Sushil Goel and LW39 RajkumarGoel, this property was sold to A4 Java Singh for more than Rs. 5 lakhs but the sale deed wasexecuted at a lesser amount. The prosecution besides relying upon these two statements have alsorelied upon the statement u/S 164 Cr.PC of Satender Gupta D6 who has stated that he had got theproperty sold to A4 for Rs. 11 lakhs. The testimony of these witnesses prima facie indicates fishytransaction.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Therefore, there is prima facie material on record to add this property in the DA.Item No. 15 to item No. 31: Separate pieces of land in Lucknow Perusal of the chargesheet wouldindicate that these are separate parcels of land acquired in the name of different persons. The plea ofCBI is that actually A1 had acquired these properties in different names. Per contra the plea ofdefence is that A1 had nothing to do with these properties and the plots are actually owned by thepersons in whose name the properties are rested. It is pertinent to mention here that at the stage ofcharge, the court cannot enter into mini trial nor can it enter into the probative value of thestatement of witnesses. Prosecution has relied upon the testimony LW21 Satish Kumar Singh as wellas testimony of LW 40, 41, 42,43,44,46, 47 and50. The defence has seriously challenged the authenticity of the statement of LW21. It has beenargued that CBI has committed forgery by manufacturing the testimony of LW21 only in order toimplicate A1. I consider that this is a matter of trial and can be seen at the stage of trial.The properties listed at item No. 15 to item No. 20 are in the name of A4 Java Sigh. Property listedat item no. 21 to 23 are in the name of A3 Juhie Singh. Properties listed at item No. 24 to 29 are inthe name of LW47 Shyam Bihari. Property listed at item No. 30 is in the name of Smt. CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Priyamvada Singh and property listed at item No. 31 is in the name of APN Singh. As far as theproperties in the name of A3 Juhie Singh and A4 Java Singh from item No. 15 to 23, the case of theCBI is that A1 had been transacting into the properties in the name of these accused persons. Therecord also reflect a pattern whereby A1 after acquisition of the properties has been transferring thesame in the name of his daughters A3 and A4. Now it would be a matter of trial that whether A3 andA4 had actually independent source of income to acquire these properties or not. I consider that atthis stage in view of testimony of prosecution witnesses, there is a prima facie case for adding theseproperties in the DA of the accused. In regard to property listed at item No. 24 to 29 in the name ofShyam Bihari, there is a specific statement of Shyam Bihari u/S 164 Cr.PC D3 that he was broughtby A1 from the village and got 3 acres of land on lease. This person was hardly educated. He statedTalab farm house and got his signatures on some documents. The witness stated that he signed as heCbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/66had been employed with them. It specifically came in the testimony that he neither had any positionnor the money to buy any land and even A1 had given Rs. 10,000 for marriage of his daughter.Therefore, the properties listed at item No. 24 to 29 can also be prima facie added as a DA of A1.Item No. 30 as per chargesheet has been sold by Sh. SP Arya, CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.IAS officer to Priyamvada Singh and similarly, item No. 31 has been sold by Shyam Bihari to A12APN Singh. It is pertinent to mention here that Smt. Priyamvada Singh is wife of A12 APN Singh.LW21 in his statement has stated that infact A1 had purchased this land in different names,however, the defence has specifically stated that the payments were made from the personal accountof APN Singh A/c No. 562, Indian Overseas Bank, Lucknow. The plea of CBI is that in this account asum of Rs. 2.5 lakhs has been received from A/c No. 2247, Karur Vysya Bank in the name of Late Sh.UP Singh which actually was opened and operated by A1. However, there is nothing on the record toeven suggest that this amount was used in any manner for the purpose of buying this land.Therefore, I consider that there is no prima facie material to attribute the property listed at No. 30 &31, to the DA of A1.Item No. 32: Plot No.1/16, Vishwas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow acquired in the name ofB.P.Khandelwal and cost of the house constructed on this plot.Perusal of the record would indicate that plot No. 1/16, Vishwaskhand, Gomti Nagar was acquiredOverseas Bank Account of A1. The plot was allotted to A6 on 24/3/83. It is not the case of the CBIthat the remaining payments were also done by A1. The second CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.charge against A6 is that A1 had spent the money for the purpose of construction of this house. Inorder to prove this fact, the prosecution has relied upon the testimony of Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal,LW26 as well as the statement of LW27 to LW30. However, the defence has taken a plea that A6 wasa senior officer in Education Department and even remained Chairman CBSE from the year 1995 to1999. A6 was stated to be Addl. Director of Education in the year 1982 and had taken housing loanfrom the account of A1, the property No. 1/16 cannot be attributed to A1. Similarly, even thedocuments of the prosecution D649 would show signature of A6 on the layout plan. The defence hasconstruction of her part. I consider that the quality of evidence in this regard against A6 is very weakand no case against A6 is made out and this property cannot be attributed to A1.Item No. 33: Plot No.1/18, Vishwas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow acquired in the name of ChhayaSingh and Anil Kumar Singh cost of the house constructed on this plot.In regard to property no. 1/18, the plot was allotted in the name of LW53 Malti Singh w/o Late Sh.Sarabhjit Singh and subsequently this plot was sold to A8 and A9 Chaya Singh. The case of the CBIis that A1 has CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/67forged the signature of LW53 Malti Singh on several documents at the time of acquisition of theproperty. It has also come in the testimony of LW53 that at the relevant time, she was in financialcrises on account of death of her husband and had no money. In this regard, the testimony of LW52Arun kumar Verma, who had executed the sale deed will in the name of A8 and A9 is also materialwho stated that no monetary transaction took place in his presence. The testimony of LW26 RajeshKumar Aggarwal is also important who has stated that A1 had spent for the cost of construction ofthis house. In this regard the testimony of LW27 to LW30 is also important. Therefore, I considerthat this property can prima facie be added in the DA of A1 however I consider that there is no primafacie evidence against A8 and A9 there is nothing on record to suggest any intention or knowledgeon part of A8 and A9 to aid and abate A1.Item No. 34: House No. 1/40, Vivek Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow acquired in the name of AnilKumar Singh and later transferred in the name of Smt.Abha Singh.In regard to house No.1/40 this was acquired in the name of Late Sh. Anil Kumar Singh, brother inlaw of A1. The case of the CBI is that the signatures of Preeti Singh were forged on this. Another pleaof CBI is that the payment of this house was made from an account which was opened and operatedby A1. However, I have not found any direct or prima facie evidence CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh &Ors.in this regard. CBI has alleged that cost of construction / addition / alteration on this house wasincurred by A1 as reflected in the testimony of LW26 Rajesh Kumar Aggarwal. The CBI has addedonly the cost of construction incurred by A1 in the chargesheet. Since the testimony of LW26 is onthe record. I consider that prima facie this can be added in the DA of accused. However, I considerthat there is no evidence direct or prima facie which could attribute A10 Abha Singh in this regard.Item No. 36 : Plot No. 2/29, Vishwas Khand, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow acquired in the name ofSmt.Abha Singh.Perusal of the record would indicate that this property was acquired by A10 in her name howeverCBI has relied upon the testimony of LW26 to LW30 to allege that A1 has incurred the cost ofconstruction on this property. I consider that in view of the prima facie statement of LW26 to 30 thecost of construction would be added in DA of A1. However, merely on the basis of these statementsnothing can be attributed against A10 Abha Singh.Item No.37 : Shop No.UGF 01, Arohi Plaza, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow acquired in the name of ShriBadri Singh: and, Item No. 38 : Shop No.UGF 02, Arohi Plaza, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow acquired inthe name of Shi Badri Singh In this regard LW56 Manish Jain has made a statement before CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.CBI that UGF 1 and 2 were sold to A1 in April 1983. A1 had purchased it in the name of Badri Singhand paid Rs.1 lakh vide cheque No.0625901 dated 21.04.93 IOB Lucknow. In view of the statementof LW56 there is a prima facie case against A1.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/68the name of Smt.Lal mani Devi and later transferred in the name of Shri Badri Singh. Thethat this property was acquired by late Smt. Lalmani Devi, mother of A1. Sh. Badri Singh inheritedthis property. There is nothing on record to show that A1 has any connection with this property.During the course of argument, Ld. PP was not able to show any evidence to connect A1 with thisproperty hence, in absence of any prima facie evidence, this cannot be attributed to A1.Item No.40: Land at Ladfora village, Distt.Nainital measuring 10 Nali & 2 Mutti Khata Khatauni, 6situated at village Ladfora Talla, Patti Sarna, Tehsil Dhari, Dt.Nainital, Uttar Pradesh acquired inthe name of Smt.Priyamvada Singh.The case of the CBI is that A1 had acquired these properties in the name of Priyamvda Singh, AlokKumar Singh, APN Singh and Rita Singh, In support of this plea, CBI has relied upon the testimonyof LW59 CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Arun Kumar Goel who has stated before CBI that he had met A1 and agreed to sell these propertiesaccordingly. However, the sale deeds were executed in the name of respective buyers. In thetestimony of LW59 there is nothing to suggest that payments were made by A1 rather A12 has madea specific plea that payments were made through his bank accounts. I consider that in view of thefact that sale deeds are in the name of the respective buyers and there is no material, even primafacie, to suggest that the funds were provided by A1 or that he had been using this property, thecharge of DA cannot be framed against A1 in respect of the same. Item No.44 : 12.5 acresagricultural land in Khasra No.263, Village Bhirva, Pargana Fakarpur, Tehsil Kaiserganj, Distt.Bahraich acquired in the name of Smt.Krishna Rani Chhabra. In respect of this property there is aspecific statement of Sh. Sudhir Chabra Son of Krishna Rani Chabra u/s.164 Cr.P.C., wherein he hasstated that the land was purchased in the name of her mother and payment was made from her ownaccount. During arguments, the prosecution was also not able to point out any direct evidence evenprima facie in this regard. Hence, it cannot be attributed to A1.CBI Vs. Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Item No.45: 10 acres agricultural land in Araji No.132, Village Hathi Chak, Pargana Fakarpur, TehsilKaiserganj, Lucknow acquired in the name of Smt.Sharada Khandelwal.The prosecution has relied upon the statement of LW15 who has only stated that this property wasnot able to point out any prima facie evidence to connect the same. Hence, the same cannot beattributed to A1.Item No.46: 6.7990 hectares of land in village Bhirva, Tehsil Mehsi, Pargana Fakarpur,Distt.Bahraich in Khata Khatauni 165 Khasra 269 acquired in the name of Shri Badri Singh Inrespect of this property prosecution has relied upon testimony of LW61 Ravi Prasad who has statedCbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/69that A1 purchased this land in the name of Sh. Badri Singh. The transaction took place at the houseof A1 and price was also settled. The whole price was paid in cash. It came in the testimony of LW61the rate per bigha was Rs.20,000 to 25,000 but the amount in sale deed was shown much less. Iconsider that in view of the statement of LW61 there is a prima facie case made out against A1.MOVABLE ASSETS In respect of the bank accounts, CBI has attributed 20 bank CBI Vs. AkhandPratap Singh & Ors.accounts to A1. However, perusal of the record has indicated that there is no prima facie evidence inrespect of account numbers listed at Sr. Nos.18, 19 and 20 and therefore the same cannot beattributed to A1. In respect of bank accounts listed at item no.1 to 17 there is prima facie evidence toframe the charge.SHARES In respect of the share transaction the defence has assailed the testimony of LW73 RajeshSharaf. After the death of LW72 Gopal the prosecution has based its case upon LW73 Rajesh Saraf,.The plea of the defence is that the court cannot rely upon the testimony of this witness as histestimony is misconceived and extorted by CBI. It may be reminded that probative value of thewitnesses cannot be look into at this stage. The defence has also made a detailed plea that theprosecution has increased the expenditure and has shown the decreased income. However, this all ismatter of trial and cannot be looked into at this stage.Late Smt. Neelam Singh, Late Sh. UP Singh, A3 Juhie Singh, A4 Java Singh, A12 APN Singh, LateSh. Ravi Singh, Late Sh. Govind Mishra, A10 Abha Singh, Sh. Badri Singh and A5 KM CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Khandelwal on share transfer forms and certificates. A1 has also forged the signatures of LW MaltiSingh, Smt. Neelam Singh Late Sh. UP Singh in respect of property transactions and bank accounts.17.1 In respect to KM Khandelwal, the main premises of CBI was that he had signed on various willsof late Sh. UP Singh, Late Govind Mishra and Late Anil Kumar Singh only in order to aid and abateA1. However, none of the original will have been produced by the court. I consider that simplybecause A1 signed on certain will which has not been challenged by any of the beneficiary or A5opened an account at the address of A1, the framing of charge would not be justified. Hence, A5 KMKhandelwal is discharged.The case against A6 BP Khandelwal was also that he actively aided and abated A1 in acquisition ofplot No.1/40 and construction of double storey on the same. I consider that the evidence producedby the prosecution in this regard is not sufficient. Hence, A6 BP Khandelwal is also discharged.In respect of A7 Madan Pal Singh the case of the prosecution is that he actively aided and abated A1in acquisition of shares being the Director and Managing Director of M/s. Venus Sugar Mill.However, the prosecution has not been able to bring any direct evidence to connect the CBI Vs.Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors.Cbi vs . Akhand Pratap Singh & Ors. on 31 July, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/105775065/70same. Hence, A7 Madan Pal Singh is also discharged.Similarly, in respect of A9 Chhaya Singh, A10 Abha Singh and A12 APN Singh also the prosecutionhas not been able to bring any prima facie evidence. Hence, in view of the detailed discussion madeherein above, A9 Chhaya singh, A10 Abha Singh and A12 APN Singh are also discharged.17.2 The revised list, after the order on charge would be as follows:Total Assets as on 31.03.1998 (at the end of the check period) S.
