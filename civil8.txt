Supreme Court of IndiaState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Bench: P.B. Sawant, N. Venkatachala           CASE NO.:Appeal (civil)  662-68 of 1991PETITIONER:STATE OF U.P. AND ORS. ETC.RESPONDENT:U.P. STATE LAW OFFICERS ASSOCIATION AND ORS. ETC.DATE OF JUDGMENT: 25/01/1994BENCH:P.B. SAWANT & N. VENKATACHALAJUDGMENT:JUDGMENT 1994(1) SCR 348 The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SAWANT, J. Leavegranted in S.L.P. Nos. 14525 and 4912 of 1991.1. This group of appeals raises an important question with regard to the status of the law officersengaged by the State Government to conduct the cases on its behalf in the High Court. Incidentally,questions bearing on the profession of the lawyer, his relationship with his client, and therelationship of the Government and for that matter of all the public bodies with the lawyers theyengage for conducting their matters, also fall for consideration,2. At the relevant time, there were 64 law officers working for the Uttar Pradesh State Governmentin the High Court of Allahabad including its Lucknow Bench. By an order dated 23.7.1990, the StateGovernment removed 26 of the said law officers. Out of these, 9 law officers had been working for along time, some of them for more than 15 years. Their continuation as law officers was till furtherorders. Another 11 officers of the removed officers had been appointed in 1982-83 and theycontinued to work till the date of their removal without renewal of their term. The remaining six lawofficers were appointed variously in March and May, 1989 for a period of one year only with astipulation that they could be removed any time without giving any reason whatsoever. Their termhad also not been renewed after the expiry of the initial period of their appointment. There is nodispute that in cases of all these 26 officers and indeed in cases of all the law officers appointed inthe High Court, the terms of appointment contained a condition that notwithstanding the period forwhich they were appointed, they could be removed at any time without giving any reasonwhatsoever.3. It appears that before issuance of the aforesaid order of removal dated 23,7.1990, the StateGovernment had issued another order on 26.5.1990 by which the system of engaging Brief Holdersin the High Court was abolished with immediate effect. By yet another order of 28.6.1990, theGovernment had authorised the Legal Remembrancer to appoint Special Counsel for any specialmatter before the High Court, The order also gave him financial and administrative powers whichState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/1were earlier exercised by the Chief Standing Counsel and the Public Prosecutor. He was furthergiven power to distribute the work to the various Standing Counsel and the Additional PublicProsecutors.4. Aggrieved by the order dated 23.7.1990, the law officers who were removed from their posts, andaggrieved by the order of 26.5.1990, the then Brief Holders approached the High Court by a writpetition contending, among other things, that their removal was against the principles of naturaljustice and that they could be removed from their officers only for valid reasons. The High Courtaccepted the contention of the law officers and by its impugned judgment, quashed the ordersremoving them from their offices. The High Court also quashed the order dated 26.5.1990 passed bythe State Government by which the Government had abolished the system of the engagement ofBrief Holders and directed the respondents to continue the said system. The High Court furtherquashed all the fresh appointments made by the State Government and directed the payment ofremuneration to the officers who were removed, from the date of their removal. In the course of thejudgment, the High Court has also made observations against the Legal Remembrancer. Theseappeals are, therefore, preferred by the State as well as those who were newly appointed by the StateGovernment as its law officers.5. Before we refer to the contentions advanced on both sides, it would be worthwhile to explain thesystem which was prevalent in the State for engaging lawyers to attend to the Government-work inthe High Court and also the role assigned to the Legal Remembrancer vis-.-vis the Governmentlawyers. Chapter V of the Legal Remembrancer's Manual (hereinafter referred to as the 'Manual')deals with the Chief Standing Counsel and the Standing Counsel in the High Court and Chapter VIof the said Manual deals with Brief Holders in the High Court. Chapter VII deals with DistrictGovernment Counsel with whom we are not concerned in the present appeals. However, thatchapter has a bearing on the contentions advanced before us and we will deal with the same whilediscussing the contentions. Suffice it for the present to bear in mind that the appoint-ment andconditions of engagement of District Government Counsel have been dealt with in the said Manualseparately from the appointment of the Chief Standing Counsel, Standing Counsel and Brief Holdersin the High Court.6. Paragraph 5.01 of Chapter V states that there shall be one Chief Standing Counsel for the HighCourt at Allahabad and another for its Lucknow Bench and such number of Standing Counsel atboth the said Benches as the State Government may from time to time appoint. Para-graph 5.02states that in making the appointments of the Chief Standing Counsel as well as the StandingCounsel, the State Government "may, if considered necessary" take into consideration the views ofthe Advocate General or the Chief Justice or any Judges of the High Court or of any Committee that"may be" constituted for the purpose. Paragraph 5.03 then refers to the responsibility of the ChiefStanding Counsel for conducting the cases. It states that he shall be responsible for the conduct ofall civil cases in the High Court to which the State Government is a party except such cases or classof cases as are excluded by the State Government by general or special order. It further states thatthe Chief Standing Counsel shall work subject to such general or special directions as may be issuedby the Advocate General or the Legal Remembrancer from time to time. Sub-paragraph (2) of thesaid paragraph states that the Government may entrust any case of special importance to theState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/2Advocate General or to a Special Counsel. Paragraph 5.04 refers to the duties of the Chief StandingCounsel. These duties include (i) representation of the State or of any authority within the State insuch other civil cases in which he might be directed or required to appear by the Government, theLegal Remembran-cer or the High Court; (ii) to present to the High Court under instructions fromthe Legal Remembrancer, appeals, or applications or petitions on behalf of the State;(iii) to advise the Government or the Legal Remembrancer when so required in any matter of a civilnature; (iv) to make suitable arrangements for the conduct of civil cases in the High Court inaccordance with any general or special order of the Government or the Legal Remembrancer; (v) toassign cases to the Standing Counsel and then to the Brief Holders appointed by the Government;(vi) to report to the Legal Remembrancer the cases in which the State Counsel had been adverselycommented upon by the High Court;(vii) to procure and submit to the legal Remembrancer copies of any judgment or order of the HighCourt that the Government may require or where immediate steps by the State Government arenecessary; (viii) to ask for instructions from the Legal Remembrancer in regard to the contest of thematters on behalf of the State Government; (ix) to report to the Legal Remembrancer the receipt ofany process on behalf of the Government and to furnish to him with a copy of the memo of appeal,revision or application as the case may be; (x) to send his opinion to the Legal Remembrancer as towhether any case is fit for further appeal to the Supreme Court and to submit to the LegalRemembrancer such returns as the latter may from time to time prescribe or require.7. Paragraph 5.05 refers to the duties of Standing Counsel and states that the Standing Counsel shallgenerally assist the Chief Standing Counsel in performing his duties and functions and shall performsuch functions and conduct such cases as may be allotted to them by the Chief Standing Counsel orby any general or special order of the Government. Paragraph 5.07 places restriction on privatepractice of both the Chief Standing Counsel and Standing Counsel. It states that they shall not, savewith the special permission, appear against the State in any civil case or proceeding nor shall theyadvise any private party regarding any civil case which might be pending or is likely to be institutedagainst the State or any State authority. It also states that they shall not, without the permission ofthe Legal Remembrancer communicate directly or indirectly to any person or authority the contentsof any documents or convey any information which has come to their possession or knowledge inthe course of their duties in any case in which they appear on behalf of the State Government, Theyshall also not accept any appointment as Director of any company without the previous sanction ofthe Government. Paragraph 5.08 requires the Chief Standing Counsel to arrange and regulate workin such a manner that an adequate number of Standing Counsel and/or Brief Holders are present inthe High Court on every day on which cases under his charge are fixed for hearing. Paragraph 5.10gives power to the State Government to transfer the Chief Standing Counsel or any StandingCounsel from Allahabad to Lucknow and vice versa in consultation with the Advocate General forsuch period and on such terms as may be determined by the Government. They may also be askedby the Legal Remembrancer to appear on behalf of the State Government in any civil case in anyCourt in the State in or outside Allahabad or Lucknow. Paragraph 5.16 requires that except whenotherwise expressly provided, all communications between the Government and the Chief StandingCounsel and the Standing Counsel shall be made through the Legal Remembrancer except in casesState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/3of urgency, But even in such cases, the copy of the communications shall invariably be sent to theLegal Remembrancer. It is not necessary to refer to the other provisions of this chapter.8. Paragraph 6.02 of Chapter VI which deals with the Brief Holders in the High Court refers to theappointment of a panel of Brief Holders in the High Court. It states that the State Government mayin consultation with the Advocate General appoint such number of Brief Holders from amongst thepracticing advocates in the High Court as it may deem necessary from time to time to conduct suchcivil and criminal cases in the High Court as may be entrusted to them. The paragraph makes it clearthat such appointments "shall not be deemed to be appointment to any office or post but onlyprofessional engagement which shall be terminable on either side at will." It requires a minimum of5 years' practice at the bar for appointment as a Brief Holder. Paragraph 6.03 states that a BriefHolder shall ordinarily be appointed in the first instance for a period not exceeding one year andthat the subsequent appointments may be for such number of years not exceeding three as the StateGovernment may deem necessary from time to time. The remuneration of the Brief Holders isreferred to at Paragraph 6.04. On the civil side, the Brief Holder is entitled to the same fee as wouldbe payable to a Standing Counsel for doing similar work and on the criminal side, the remunerationis mentioned in terms of fee per day irrespective of the number of cases conducted and the hours ofwork put in by him. No salary or any other kind of monthly remuneration is payable to him. In caseof dispute with regard to the fee, the decision of the Legal Remembrancer is to be final. Paragraph6.05 states that it is the Government Advocate who shall allot criminal cases and the Chief Stand-ingCounsel who shall allot civil cases to the Brief Holders and shall also exercise supervision andcontrol over them. Paragraph 6.06 then states that the Government Advocate and the ChiefStanding Counsel shall entrust only such cases to the Brief Holders which cannot be attended to bythem or other law officers under them and which are not required to be con-ducted personally bythem. It also details classes of cases which shall not, ordinarily, be entrusted to the Brief Holders.Paragraph 6.07 requires the entrustment of cases to the Brief Holders by rotation in a manner asmay ensure an equitable distribution of work among all the of them except where the GovernmentAdvocate or the Chief Standing Counsel may in the interest of the better prosecution of cases think itnecessary to depart from the rule. Paragraph 6.11 gives the Brief Holder, the right to private practiceand also for accepting cases against the Government. Paragraph 6.13 refers to the manner ofremoval of Brief Holder and states that the Government may at any time without prior notice andwithout assigning any reason whatsoever, remove the name of the Brief Holder from its panel.Paragraph 6.16 prohibits Brief Holders from participating in any political Brief Holders fromparticipating in any political activity so long as they work as Brief Holders. The other provision ofthe chapter are not relevant for our purpose.9. The conditions of service of the Government Advocate and Additional Government Advocate,Deputy Government Advocate or Assistant Government Advocate for conducting criminal mattersin the High Court are the same as that of the Chief Standing Counsel and the Standing Counselrespectively.10. Since the respondents have relied heavily on a judgment of this Court in Kumari ShrilekhaVidyarthi and Others v. State of Uttar Pradesh others, [1991] 1 S.C.C. 212, which deals specificallywith appointments and removal of the District Government Counsel and the Additional/AssistantState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/4District Government Counsel, and the appellants have tried to distinguish the said judgment, it isnecessary to examine the relevant conditions of service of the District Government Counsel asdetailed hi Chapter VII of the said Manual. The District Government Counsel are legal practitionersappointed by the State Government to conduct in any court other than the High Court such civil,criminal or revenue cases on behalf of the State Government as may be assigned to them eithergenerally or specially (Paragraph 7.01). The Government have also the power to appoint Additionalor Assistant District Government Counsel or Subordinate District Government Counsel to assist theDistrict Government Counsel (Para-graph 7.02). Paragraph 7.03 relates to the appointment of theDistrict Government Counsel. Whenever the post of any of the District Govern-ment Counsel islikely to fall vacant or when a new post has been created, the concerned District Magistrate has tonotify the vacancy to the members of the Bar. The qualification for appointment as a DistrictGovernment Counsel, Assistant District Government Counsel and Sub-District Govern-mentCounsel is 10 years', 7 years', and 5 years' practice respectively. The District Magistrate shall also askthose who want to be considered for appointment to give their names to him with their particularssuch as age, length of practice at the Bar, proficiency in Hindi, income tax paid by him onprofessional income during the last three years, details of the work handled by them during thepreceding two years duly verified by the court and also to state whether they have practiced on thecriminal, civil or revenue side. The District Government Counsel and the legal practitioners of theneighboring districts are also eligible to be considered for the said post and they have to forwardtheir particulars through their District Magistrate who has to offer his own remarks on theparticulars so given. When the names are so received, they have to be considered by the DistrictMagistrate in consultation with the District Judge. The District Magistrate has to give due weight tothe claim of the existing incumbents if any, and has to submit confidentially in the order ofpreference the names of the legal practitioners to the Legal Remembrancer. He has also to give hisopinion, particularly, about the character, professional conduct and in-tegrity of the candidate andforward to the Legal Remembrancer the opinion of the District Judge on the suitability and meritsof each can-didate. The District Magistrate has also to send to the Legal Remembran-cer, the biodata submitted by other candidates with such comments that he and the District Judge may like tomake. The District Magistrate is also required to recommend the name of any person who may beconsidered fit by him although he has not formally supplied has particulars. Paragraph 7.04 thenstates that on receipt of the recommendations of the District magistrate, the Legal Remembrancermay, if necessary, make such further inquiry about the candidate as he may deem necessary andthen submit the recommendations of the District Magistrate along with his own opinion for theorders of the Government whose decision shall be final. Paragraph 7.06 states that the legalpractitions who are finally selected by the Government may be appointed District GovernmentCounsel for one year. At the end of the period of one year, the District Magistrate after consultingthe District Judge has to submit a report on his work and conduct to the Legal Remembrancertogether with the statement of work done by him. If his work and conduct are found to beunsatisfactory, the matter has to be reported to the Government for orders. If the report on his workand conduct is satisfactory, the appointee May be furnished with a deed of engagement in From No.1 annexed to the manual and the engagement is to be for a term not exceeding three years. The saidparagraph makes it explicitly clear that the appointment of a legal practitioner as DistrictGovernment Counsel is only a professional engagement terminable at will on either side and is notan appointment to a post under the Government Accordingly, the Government reserves the power toState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/5terminate the appointment of any District Government Counsel at any time without assigning anyreason. Para 7.07 bars the District Government Counsel from participating in political activities.Paragraph 7.08 deals with the renewal of the term of the District Government Counsel and statesthat at least three months before the expiry of the term, the District Magistrate shall after consultingthe District Judge and considering the incumbent's past record of work and conduct and age, reportto the Legal Remembrancer together with a statement of work done by him, whether in his opinion,the term of appointment of such counsel should be renewed or not. The District Magistrate has tosend along with his own recommendations, the opinion of the District Judge. While giving hisrecommendations for renewal of the term, the District Judge has to give an estimate of the quality ofthe counsel's work from the judicial standpoint, his capacity as a lawyer and his professionalconduct. Similarly, the District Magistrate while giving his report about the suitability of the DistrictGovernment Counsel from the administrative point of view, has to report on the candidate's publicreputation in general, his character, integrity and professional conduct. If the Government agreeswith the recommendations of the District Magistrate for the renewal of the term of the GovernmentCounsel, it may pass orders for reappointing him for a period not exceeding three years. If theGovern-ment decides not to reappoint any Government Counsel, the Legal Remembrancer may callupon the District Magistrate to forward fresh recommendations. This procedure is to be followed onthe expiry of every successive period of renewed appointment. For the above purpose, the DistrictMagistrate and the District Judge is required to keep a character roll and maintain a record of thework done by the District Government Counsel and the capacity displayed by him in the discharge ofhis work. The Government (in Judicial Advice section) is also required to keep similar character rollbased upon the copy of the confidential reports recorded by the District Magistrate and the DistrictJudge, and forward it to the Legal Remembrancer. The shortcomings on the part of the DistrictGovernment Counsel have all one to be brought to the notice of the Legal Remembrancer. TheDistrict Government Counsel (Civil), is prohibited altogether from advising or appearing against theState or Central Govern-ment in any civil case pertaining to the district or the local area to which heis appointed. However, he may appear against the State or the Central Government with the priorpermission of the Legal Remembrancer in any civil case in which he has not been retained by theGovernment. Subject to this restriction, the District Government Counsel (Civil), has a right toprivate practice.11. The District Government Counsel (Civil) is prohibited from becoming a counsel of anyMunicipality or Municipal Corporation or other local authorities of the area to which he isappointed. The Assistant District Government Counsel (Civil) is prohibited from appearing in suitsinstituted by private parties against the State or Union of India in courts in which according to theallocation or work, he is alone authorised to represent the State. He is, however, free to take upprivate cases against the State or Union of India in other courts. Similar restriction is placed on theSub-District Government Counsel. As regards, the District Government Counsel (Criminal) andAdditional District Government Counsel (Criminal), they are prohibited from appearing for anyprivate party in any criminal case. However, with certain exceptions, with the prior approval of theLegal Remembrancer, they are allowed to appear. Similar restrictions are placed on DistrictGovernment Counsel (Revenue). Para 7.18 states that the District Government Counsel in a districtshall be subject to the supervision of the Legal Remembrancer as well as the District Magistrate.Their confidential reports are also to be submitted by the District Magistrate to the GovernmentState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/6through the Legal Remembrancer. Paragraphs 7.19-7.22 deal with the duties of the DistrictGovernment Counsel (Civil), (Criminal), (Revenue) respectively. Paragraphs 7.24 and paragraphs7.26-7.45 deal with the fees payable to the District Government Counsel. Para 7.61 gives power tothe Legal Remembrancer to forfeit the fees payable to the District Government Counsel in certaincases. The conditions of service of the Additional/Assistant/Subordinate District GovernmentCounsel are similar to those of the District Government Counsel mutatis mutandis.12. The appointment of lawyers by the Government and the public bodies to conduct work on theirbehalf, and their subsequent removal from such appointment have to be examined from threedifferent angles viz., the nature of the legal profession, the interests of the public and the modes ofthe appointment and removal13. Legal profession is essentially a service-oriented profession. The ancestor of to-day's lawyer wasno more than a spokesman who rendered his services to the needy members of the society byarticulating their case before the authorities that be. The services were rendered without regard tothe remuneration received or to be received. With the growth of litigation, lawyering became afull-time occupation and most of the lawyers came to depend upon it as the sole source of livelihood.The nature of the service rendered by the lawyers was private till the government and the publicbodies started engaging them to conduct cases on their behalf. The govern-ment, and the publicbodies engaged the services of the lawyers purely on a contractual basis either for a specified case orfor a specified or an unspecified period. Although the contract in some cases prohibited the lawyersfrom accepting private briefs, the nature of the contract did not alter from one of professionalengagement to that of employment. The lawyer of the Government or a public body was not itsemployee but was professional practitioner engaged to do the specified work. This is so even to-day,though the lawyers on the full-time rolls of the government and the public bodies are described astheir law officers. It is precisely for this reason that in the case of such law officers, the saving clauseof Rule 49 of the Bar Council of India Rules, waives the prohibition imposed by the said rule againstthe acceptance by a lawyer of a full-time employment.14. The relationship between the lawyer and his client is one of trust and confidence. The clientengages a lawyer for personal reasons and is at liberty to leave his also, for the same reasons. He isunder no obligation to give reasons for withdrawing his brief from his lawyer. The lawyer in turn isnot an agent of his client but his dignified, responsible spokesman. He is not bound to tell the courtevery fact or urge every proposition of law which his client wants him to do, however irrelevant itmay be. He is essentially an advisor to his client and is rightly called a counsel in some jurisdictions.Once acquainted with the facts of the case, it is the lawyer's discretion to choose the facts and thepoints of taw which he would advance. Being a responsible officer of the court and an importantadjunct of the administration of justice, the lawyer also owes a duty to the court as well as to theopposite side. He was to be fair to ensure that justice is done. He demeans himself if he acts merelyas a mouthpiece of his client. This relationship between the lawyer and the private client is equallyvalid between him and the public bodies.15. Over the years, the public sector has grown considerably, and with its extension and expansion,the number of lawyers engaged in the public sector has increased noticeably, so much so, that it canState Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/7truly be said that to-day there is a public sector in the legal profession as well. The expansion of thepublic sector activities has necessitated the maintenance of a permanent panel of lawyers. Some ofthe lawyers are also in full-time employment of the public institutions as their law officers. Theprofile of the legal profession has thus undergone a change.16. The Government or the public body represents public interests, and whoever is in charge ofrunning their affairs, is no more than a trustee or a custodian of the public interests. The protectionof the public interests to the maximum extent and in the best possible manner is his primary duty.The public bodies are, therefore, under an obligation to the society to take the best possible steps tosafeguard its interests. This obligation imposes on them the duty to engage the most competentservants, agents, advisors, spokesmen and representatives for conducting their affairs. Hence, in theselection of their lawyers, they are duty-bound to make earnest efforts to find the best from amongthose available at the particular time. This is more so because the claims of and against the publicbodies are generally monetarily substantial and socially crucial with far-reaching consequences.17. The mode of appointment of lawyers for the public bodies, therefore, has to be in conformitywith the obligation cast on them to select the most meritorious. An open invitation to the lawyers tocompete for the posts is by far the best mode of such selection. But sometimes the best may notcompete or a competent candidate may not be available from among the competitors. In suchcircumstances, the public bodies may resort to other methods such as inviting and appointing thebest available, although he may not have applied for the post. Whatever the method adopted, it mustbe shown that the search for the meritorious was undertaken and the appointments were made onlyon the basis of the merit and not for any other consideration.18. It would be evident from Chapter V of the said Manual that to appoint the Chief StandingCounsel, the Standing Counsel and the Government Advocate, Additional Government Advocate,Deputy Government Advocate and Assistant Government Advocate, the State Government is underno obligation to consult even its Advocate General must less the Chief Justice or any judges of theHigh Court or to take into consideration, the views of any committee that "may" be constituted forthe purpose. The State Government has a discretion. It may or may not ascertain the views of any ofthem while making the said appointments. Even where it chooses to consult them, their views arenot binding on it. The appointments may, therefore, be made on considerations other than meritand there exists no provision to prevent such appointments. The method of appointment is indeednot calculated to ensure that the meritorious alone will always be appointed or that theappointments made will not be on considerations other than merit. In the absence of guidelines, theappointments may be made purely on personal or political considerations, and be arbitrary. Thisbeing so those who come to be appointed by such arbitrary procedure, can hardly complain if thetermination of their appointment is equally arbitrary. Those who come by the backdoor have to goby the same door. This is more so when the order of appointment itself stipulates that theappoint-ment is terminable at any time without assigning any reason. Such appoint-ments aremade, accepted and understood by both sides to be purely professional engagements till they last.The fact that they are made by public bodies cannot vest them with additional sanctity. Everyappointment made to a public office, howsoever made, is not necessarily vested with public sanctity.There is, therefore, no public interest involved in saving all appointments irrespective of their mode.State Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/8From the inception some engage-ments and contracts may be the product of the operation of thespoils system. There need be no legal anxiety to save them.19. As the facts narrated earlier show, out of 26 respondent-law officers, the period of contract ofnine of them had expired and they were continued till further orders. The remaining seventeen hadcontinued after the expiry of their initial term without even formal orders of extension. In otherwords, none of the 26 officers had any right to hold the office on the date to their removal, evenunder the initial terms of appointment which stipulated the contractual period. This is apart fromthe fact that the terms of the contracts also provided that the appointment could be terminated atany time without assigning reason. The reliance placed by the respon-dents in this behalf on KumariShrilekha Vidyarthi and Ors. v. State of Uttar Pradesh and Ors., [1991] 1 S.C.C. 212, is misplaced forthe obvious reason that the decision relates to the appointment of the District Government Counseland the Additional/Assistant District Government Counsel who are the law officers appointed by theState Government to conduct civil, criminal and revenue cases in any court other than the HighCourt. Their appointments are made through open competition from among those who are eligiblefor appointment and strictly on the basis of merit as evidenced by the particulars of their practice,opinions of the District Magistrate and the District Judge and also after taking into considerationtheir character and conduct. Their appointment is in the first instance for one year. It is only aftertheir satisfactory performance during that period that a deed of engagement is given to them, andeven then the engagement is to be for a term not exceeding three years. The renewal of their furtherterm again depends upon the quality of work and conduct, capacity as a lawyer, professionalconduct, public reputation in general, and character and integrity as certified by the DistrictMagistrate and the District Judge. For the said purpose, the District Magistrate and the DistrictJudge is required to maintain a character roll and a record of the work done by the officer and thecapacity displayed by him in discharge of the work. His work is also subject to strict supervision. Theshortcomings in the work are re-quired to be brought to the notice of the Legal Remembrancer. Itwill thus be seen that the appointment of the two sets of officers viz., the Govern-ment Counsel inthe High Court with whom we are concerned, and the District Government Counsel with whom thesaid decision was concerned, are made by dissimilar procedures. The latter are not appointed as apart of the spoils system. Having been selected on merit and for no other consideration, they areentitled to continue in their office for the period of the contract of their engagement and they can beremoved only for valid reasons. The people are interested in their continuance for the period of theircontracts and in their non-substitution by those who may come in through the spoils system. It is inthese circumstances that this Court held that the wholesale termination of their services wasarbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. The ratio of the said decision can hardly beapplied to the appointments of the law officers in the High Court whose appointment itself wasarbitrary and was made in disregard of Article 14 of the Constitution as pointed oat above. What isfurther, since the appointment of District Government Counsel is made strictly on the basis ofcomparative merits and after screening at different levels, the termination of their services is notconsistent with the public interests. We are, therefore of the view that the High Court committed apatent error of law in setting aside the order dated 23.7.1990 terminating the services of therespondent-law officers.State Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P. State Law Officers ... on 25 January, 1994Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/64632052/920. Coming now to the High Court's order setting aside the Govern-ment Order dated 26.5.1990 bywhich the Government had abolished the system of Brief Holders, and instead the power was givento the Legal Remembrancer to appoint special counsel for special matters, we are of the view thatthe High Court has committed a still graver error. As has been pointed out above, Chapter VI of thesaid Manual deals with the system of appointing a panel of Brief Holders in the High Court. Theappointment of the lawyers on the panel of Brief Holders is made by the State Government only inconsultation with the Advocate General who is its own officer and from among the advocates of theHigh Court who have completed a minimum of five years practice at the Bar. The selection of BriefHolders is not made after open competition. Their appointment is purely at the discretion of theState Government. The Brief Holders are farther appointed to handle that work which cannot beattended to by the Government Advocate and Chief Standing Counsel. No salary or any other kind ofmonthly remuneration is payable to them. They are paid per brief handled by them. They are notbarred from private practice or from accepting cases against the Government. It will thus beapparent that their appointment is in supernumerary capacity. It is necessitated because there maybe work which cannot be attended to by the Government Advocate and the Chief Standing Counsel.They are not assured of any regular work much less any regular fee or remuneration. They get briefsonly if the Government Advocate and Chief Standing Counsel are over worked and not otherwise.They are like ad hoc counsel engaged for doing a particular work when available. There onlyqualification is that they are on the panel of the counsel to be so appointed for handling the surpluswork. We are, therefore, at a loss to understand as to how any fault can be found with theGovernment if the Government has now thought it fit to abolish the said system and to appoint eachtime special counsel for special cases in their place.21. It is evident from the tenor of the High Court judgment that the Legal Remembrancer has beenmade a special target and has been treated almost like the villain of the piece. The judgment ignoresthat the Legal Remembrancer as a responsible officer and part of the government always had a roleto play in the appointments of the counsel, in the distribution of the work among them and also insupervising their work and in sanction-ing their bills. For this purpose, we have referred to therelevant provisions of Chapters V, VI and VII of the Manual in extenso. Even a cursory reading ofthe said chapters, will show that no material additional power has been vested in him by theGovernment on account of the present measures. In any case, if the Government has chosen to doso, the Legal Remembrancer can hardly be blamed for the same. Certainly he does not deserve thekind of compliments which the High Court has chosen to pay him. The comments and observationsmade against him are, therefore, both unjustified and unfortunate.22. In the result, we set aside the judgment of the High Court and declare that both the orders dated23.7.1990 and 26.5.1990 are valid and proper. We further hold that the termination of theappointment of the respondent-law officers was valid and proper. We also hold that the directiongiven by the High Court to the Government to continue the system of Brief Holders is unjustifiedand the same stands quashed. We also set aside the order of the High Court quashing the freshappointments and directing payments to the officers whose appointments were terminated. Theappeals are allowed accordingly. However, in the circumstances of the case, there shall be no orderas to costs.State Of U.P. And Ors. Etc vs U.P.
