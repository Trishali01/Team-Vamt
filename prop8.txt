Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 72 of 92 (79) Dr.Kulbhushan Goyal has proved having opined that injury No. 2, 4 and 9 were sufficient to causedeath in the ordinary course of nature individually or collectively and that all the injuries areantemortem in nature caused by sharp cutting penetrating object. He has also proved that the causeconsequent upon neck injuries, injuries to kidney, intestines and sacrotun and mode of death washomicidal and time since death was about two and a half days. The postmortem examination wasgot conducted on 15.10.2008 at 3:45 PM meaning thereby that the death of the deceased would havebeen caused between 3:45 AM to 4:00 AM on 13.10.2008. In view of the above, I hereby hold thatthe medical evidence is compatible to the prosecution case of homicidal death of the deceased.Forensic Evidence:(80) Dr. Anita Chhari (PW11) has proved the biological and serological reports which areEx.PW11/A and Ex.PW11/B in respect of the various exhibits. According to the said reports, humanblood of 'O' Group (belonging to the deceased) was found on bed sheets, mattress covers whereasjeans pants, baniyan, shirt, handkerchief which were allegedly got recovered by the accused do notshow any results. Though human blood was found on the said clothes but the St. Vs. Balaji KaushalChapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 73 of 92 results regarding Grouping areinconclusive. It is writ large that the forensic evidence does not connect the accused with theincident. Recovery of the clothes of the accused/ No recovery of the weapon of offence:(81) The case of the prosecution is that pursuant to his arrest the accused Balaji Kaushal made adisclosure statement which is Ex.PW26/A. Pursuant to the said disclosure statement the accused ledout the place where he had thrown his blood stained clothes and knife in a polythene from therunning train. It is also the case of the prosecution that the accused got recovered the clothes whichhe was work at the time of the incident but the alleged weapon of offence i.e. the knife could not berecovered.(82) Ld. Addl. PP for the State has argued that the recovery of the blood stained clothes at theinstance of the accused Balaji Kaushal is a strong pointer towards the guilt of the accused. Ld.Defence Counsel on the other hand has vehemently argued that the entire evidence has been createdState vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/30and concocted by the Investigating Officer Yashpal Singh in connivance with the brother of thedeceased namely Radhey Shyam who has deliberately chosen not to appear before the Court todepose fearing his exposure. He has pointed out that after the incident and during the trial of theassets of the deceased St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No.74 of 92 including his LIC policies which had been collected by the Investigating Officer from thehouse of the deceased, were handed over by the Investigating Officer to Radhey Shyam who hadeven encashed the same despite the fact that it is the wife and family of the deceased who had thefirst right over the same. He has argued that this being the background no reliance can be placed onthe recovery of the clothes. In support of this contentions the Ld. Defence Counsel has placed hisreliance on the following authorities:1. Anjlus Dungdung Vs. State of Jharkhand, reported in AIR 2005 Supreme Court1394.2. Arun Kumar Vs. State of Delhi, reported in 1996 JCC 327.3. Satish Kumar Vs. State, reported in 1996 Cri.L.J. 265.4. N. Rajendra Prasad Bhat Vs. State of Karnataka, reported in 1996 Cri.L.J. 257.5. State of Punjab Vs. Sarup Singh, reported in 1998 Cri.L.J.3292.6. Balwinder Singh Vs. State of Punjab, reported in 1996 Cri.L.J. 883.(83) Before analyzing the evidence on merits, it is necessary to observe that as per the provisions ofSection 27 of Evidence Act, which is in the nature of a proviso to Section 26 of the Act, to the extentit is relevant, when any fact is deposed to as discovered in St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIRNo.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 75 of 92 consequence of information received from aperson accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of such information,whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered, may beproved. Thus the requirement of law is that before the fact discovered in consequence of aninformation received from an accused is allowed to be proved, he (accused) needs to be in thecustody of a police officer.(84) Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act explains the meaning of the word Fact. It provides that afact means and includes:1. Anything, state of things, or relation of things, or capable of being perceived by thesenses,2. Any mental condition of which any person is conscious.State vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/31(85) It further provides five illustrations as to what would constitute a fact which are as under:1. That there are certain objects arranged in a certain order in a certain place, is a fact2. That a man heard or saw something, is a fact.3. That a man said certain words, is a fact.4. That a man holds a certain opinion, has a certain intention, acts in good faith, orfraudulently, or uses a particular word in a particular sense, or is or was at a specifiedtime conscious of a particular sensation, is a fact.5. That a man has a certain reputation, is a fact.joint reading of Section 3 and Section 27 of Evidence Act would apply that as much of the statementas would relate to the discovery of fact connected with the accused would be admissible in evidence.The discovery of the fact is not only the discovery of the articles but also the discovery of the fact thatthe articles were kept by a particular accused at a particular place because in principle there is nodifference between the statement made by the accused to the effect that "I will show you the personto whom I have given the articles" and the statement that "I will show you the place where I havekept the articles".(87) The Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of K.Chinnaswamy Reddy Vs. State of A.P. reported in AIR 1962 SC 1788 had exhaustively discussed thescope and ambit of Section 27 of the Evidence Act had considered the question as to whether thestatement of the accused to the effect that "he had hidden them (the ornaments)" and "would pointout the place", where they were, is wholly admissible in evidence under S. 27 or only that part of it isadmissible where he stated that he would point out the place but not that part where he stated thathe had hidden the ornaments. In the above case the Ld. Sessions Judge had relied upon thea part of the statement leading to the recovery of a knife in a murder case was held inadmissible bythe Judicial St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 77 of 92Committee. It was observed by My Lords of the Hon'ble Supreme Court that in the above case"Provided that when any fact is deposed to as discovered in consequence of information receivedfrom a person, accused of any offence, in the custody of a police officer, so much of suchinformation, whether it amounts to a confession or not, as relates distinctly to the fact therebydiscovered, may be proved......"".... this section is an exception to Ss. 25 and 26 which prohibit the proof of a confession made to apolice officer or a confession made while a person is in police custody unless it is made in immediatepresence of a Magistrate. Section 27 allows that part of the statement made by the accused to theState vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/32police "whether it amounts to a confession or not" which relates distinctly to the fact therebydiscovered to be proved. Thus even a confessional statement before the police which distinctlyrelates to the discovery of a fact may be proved under S.27. The Judicial Committee had in that case to consider how much of the information given by theaccused to the police would be admissible under S. 27 and laid stress on the words "so much of suchinformation........... as relates distinctly to the fact thereby discovered" in that connection. It heldthat the extent of the information admissible must depend on the exact nature of the fact discoveredto which such information is required to relate. It was further pointed out that "the fact discoveredembraces the place from which the object is St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PSMaurya Enclave Page No. 78 of 92 produced and the knowledge of the accused as to this, and theinformation given must relate distinctly to this fact....""........Information as to past user, or the past history of the object produced is not related to itsdiscovery in the setting in which it is discovered. This was exemplified further by the JudicialCommittee by observing that the information supplied by a person in custody that 'I will produce aknife concealed in the roof of my house' leads to the discovery of the fact that a knife is concealed inthe house of the informant to his knowledge and if the knife is proved to have been used in thecommission of the offence, the fact discovered is very relevant. If, however, to the statement thewords be added 'with which I stabbed A', these words are inadmissible since they do not relate to thediscovery of the knife in the house of the informant......"(88) After considering the settled principles the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as under:"......If we may respectfully say so, this case clearly brings out what part of thestatement is admissible under  S. 27. It is only that part which distinctly relates to thediscovery which is admissible; but if any part of the statement distinctly relates to thediscovery it will be admissible wholly and the court cannot say that it will excise onepart of the statement because it is of a confessional nature.Section 27 makes that part of the statement which is distinctly related to the discovery admissible asSt. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 79 of 92 a whole,whether it be in the nature of confession or not. Now the statement in this case is said to be that theappellant stated that he would show the place where he had hidden the ornaments. The SessionsJudge has held that part of this statement which is to the effect "where he had hidden them"is not admissible. It is clear that if that part of the statement is excised the remaining statement(namely, that he would show the place) would be completely meaningless. The whole of thisstatement in our opinion relates distinctly to the discovery of ornaments and is admissible under S.27 of the Indian Evidence Act. The words "where he had hidden them" are not on a par with thewords "with which I stabbed the deceased" in the example given in the judgment of the JudicialCommittee. These words (namely, where he had hidden them) have nothing to do with the pasthistory of the crime and are distinctly related to the actual discovery that took place by virtue of thatstatement. It is however urged that in a case where the offence consists of possession even the wordsState vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/33"where he had hidden them" would be inadmissible as they would amount to an admission by theaccused that he was in possession. There are in our opinion two answers to this argument. In thefirst place  S. 27 itself says that where the statement distinctly relates to the discovery it will beadmissible whether it amounts to a confession or not. In the second place, these words bythemselves though they may show possession of the appellant would not prove the offence, for afterthe articles have been recovered the St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS MauryaEnclave Page No. 80 of 92 prosecution has still to show that the articles recovered are connectedwith the crime, i.e., in this case, the prosecution will have to show that they are stolen property. Weare, therefore, of opinion that the entire statement of the appellant (as well as of the other accusedwho stated that he had given the ornament to Bada Sab and would have it recovered from him)would be admissible in evidence and the Sessions Judge was wrong in ruling out part of it.Therefore, as relevant and admissible evidence was ruled out by the Sessions Judge, this is a fit casewhere the High Court would be entitled to set aside the finding of acquittal in revision though it isunfortunate that the High Court did not confine itself only to this point and went on to make ratherstrong remarks about other parts of the evidence.(89) Later in the year 1969 the Three Judges Bench of the Hon'ble Supreme Court has in the case ofZaffar Hussain Dastagir Vs. State of Maharastra reported in 1969 (2) SCC 872 while dealing with theapplicability of the provisions of Section 27 of the Indian Evident Act relied upon the case of K.Chinnaswamy Reddy Vs. State of A.P. observed as under:"....in order that the Section may apply the prosecution must establish theinformation given by the accused led to the discovery of some fact deposed to by himand the discovery must be of some fact which the police had not previously learntfrom other sources and that the knowledge St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIRNo.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 81 of 92 of the fact was first derived frominformation given by the accused.The essential ingredient of the Section is that the information given by the accusedmust led to the discovery of the fact which is the direct outcome of such information;secondly only such portion of the information given as is distinctly connected withthe said discovery is admissible against the accused and thirdly the discovery of thefact must relate to the commission of some offence.(90) In the said case the Hon'ble Supreme Court further went to explain that "..... In a case wherethe accused is charged with theft of articles or receiving stolen articles states to the police "I willshow you the articles at the place where I have kept them" and the articles were actually found there,there can be no doubt that the information given by the accused led to the discovery of a fact that iskeeping of the articles by the accused at the place mentioned. However, the discovery of the factdeposed to in such a case is not the discovery of the articles but the discovery of the fact that thearticles were kept by the accused at a particular place. It was observed that in principle, there is nodifference between the above statement and that made by the accused in the case which in effect isthat "I will show you the person whom I have given the diamonds exceeding 200 in number". Theonly difference between the two statements is that a "named person" is substituted for "the place"State vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/34where the St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 82 of 92articles are kept. In neither case are the articles of the diamonds, in fact discovered. There can be nodoubt that the portion of the alleged statement of the accused would be admissible in evidence......"(91) Applying the settled principles of law to the facts of the present case it is evident Firstly that thealleged recovery of the clothes was effected after 15 days of the incident when the accused wasadmittedly in police custody. Secondly the said clothes were got recovered from an open place whichis accessible to all and the possibility of any other person having planted the same cannot be ruledout. (Even if I hold that the testimony of the police officers is correct to the extent that it is accusedwho made his disclosure statement pursuant to which the recovery of the clothes had been effected,yet the discovery is not being from any hidden place, the disclosure statement lost its importance).Thirdly no doubt, the prosecution has proved that the said clothes belonged to the accused (byexamining the tailor Maruti Vittal Jogeswar - PW8 and the manage of the garments shop Harishthe presence of blood of the deceased so as to connect the accused with the offence. Fourthly, thepointing out memos so prepared at the instance of the accused would be of no consequence, theplace of incident being already known to the police. Lastly the clothes were St. Vs. Balaji KaushalChapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 83 of 92 sent to FSL for examination andeven the FSL report does not assist the prosecution in any manner so as to connect the accused withthe offence (alleged blood stains on the clothes have not been established to be of the deceased).(92) In view of the above, I hereby hold that despite the alleged recovery of the clothes belonging tothe accused at the instance of the accused, the prosecution has not been able to conclusively connectthe accused Balaji Kaushal Chapre with the alleged recovery of clothes.Circumstantial evidence/ Conduct of brother of the deceased namely Radhey Shyam is suspicious:(93) The entire case of the prosecution revolves around the suspicion expressed by the brother of thedeceased namely Radhey Shyam. It is a settled law that the suspicion, however strong, cannot takeplace of proof. Reference in this regard be made to the case of Anjlus Dungdung Vs. State ofJharkhand, reported in AIR 2005 Supreme Court 1394. In the present case where there are largenumber of missing links, the circumstantial evidence that the accused had come to Delhi and waspresent in Delhi at the time of the incident or that he was present in the area at around 9:30 PMwhen he made a call to Nagpur, cannot be taken as a circumstance against the accused. No motivehas been shown and the only evidence on record against the accused is his own disclosure coupledwith the recovery of his St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave PageNo. 84 of 92 clothes (on which clothes the blood stains did not match with that of the deceased asper the FSL report). The conduct of the star witness of the prosecution namely Radhey Shyamthe Court on 29.9.2010 but his examination in chief could not be completed. Radhey Shyam (PW9)has alleged that the accused and his family was harassing his deceased brother for money and thewife of his brother was also insisting to give money to the accused since she herself resided with herfather at Nagpur but the deceased wanted to stay with him. After the examination in chief of thewitness Radhey Shyam was deferred, despite repeated opportunities and service he did not appearin the Court. The summons of this Court dated 12.12.2011 were served upon the witness RadheyState vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/35Shyam on 29.2.2012 for his appearance before this Court on 14.3.2012 despite which he did notappear. Again the summons of this Court were served upon the witness Radhey Shyam on 19.4.2012despite which he did not appear and ultimately 20.4.2012 the evidence of the prosecution wasclosed and hence his testimony is not liable to be read into evidence.(94) The accused Balaji Kaushal Chapre has examined his daughter Ms. Sonal Mitaram Dekate (i.e.the wife of the deceased) as DW1. She has made allegations against her brother in law RadheyShyam. The marriage between the deceased and Ms. Sonal was a love St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre,FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 85 of 92 marriage and after her marriage she cameto her matrimonial home in Delhi and as per her statement she started living with the deceased andon 19.5.2004 a male child was born to them. Till 2008 she resided with the accused and during thisperiod the deceased purchase a plot in the area of Deep Vihar, Rohini which was in her name andaltercations took place between the deceased and his family members on this issue and Radheyreceipt of Bayana is Ex.DW1/A and thereafter he again purchased a plot in the area of Najafgarh inBalaji) received a telephone call from her husband in the noon time and told him to call up again inthe evening since (deceased) wanted to talk to her and again in the evening about 9:00 PM herhusband made a call which was attended to by her and on 14.10.2008 she came to know that herhusband had been killed.(95) In her statement Ms. Sonal (DW1) made specific allegations against Radhey Shyam of havingbribed the Investigating Officer of the case and according to her she had been directed to St. Vs.Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 86 of 92 produce their bagof her father and brother and which clothes had been thereafter planted. According to her, when theInvestigating Officer handed over the keys of the flat to her, she found that no documents includingLIC policy, documents of plot and other documents were not present and even the mobile phone ofher husband and his identity card were missing. Further, she has clarified that the shirt of lightgreen colour recovered near the dead body which is Ex.PW11/15 is the same shirt which belonging toher brother in law Radhey Shyam which she had seen him wearing at a Bhandara (religiousceremony) in Maharastra.(96) It is evident from the record that Radhey Shyam (PW9) did not appear before the Court tocomplete his deposition and hence his testimony is liable to be discarded. Further, no motive hasbeen proved or established. On the other hand it does not appear probable or possible that a fatherwould ruin the matrimonial life of his young daughter for no apparent reason (being a happymarriage). It is writ large from the testimony of Ms. Sonal (DW1) that the relations between thedeceased and his brother Radhey Shyam were not cordial. The fact that she had been staying withthe deceased till 2008 proves that the relations between the deceased and his wife (Ms. Sonal) werenormal and under the given circumstances, without any provocation it is impossible that theState vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/36accused would have killed the deceased. Why St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PSMaurya Enclave Page No. 87 of 92 would the accused kill the deceased? No answer to this questionhas been provided by the prosecution. The prosecution has not been able to specify the motive of thecrime rather on the contrary the wife of the deceased has made specific allegations against herbrother in law Radhey Shyam who was a Station Master working in Railways and could easily travelfrom one place to another without difficulty. No investigations were conducted on these aspects.Two versions have emerged, one which implicates the accused and the other which equallyimplicates the brother of the deceased (Radhey Shyam) or else there was no reason why after thedeath of the deceased he would have taken possession of the assets of the deceased and convertedthem to his own use despite the wife and child of the deceased having a first right over the same.Here, I may observe that even the role of the Investigating Officer in handing over the LICs andother valuable securities of the deceased to Radhey Shyam at his own level was without anyauthority of law and beyond his jurisdiction. Hence, this being the background the InvestigatingOfficer having failed to conduct any investigations on the other possibilities, the version whichfavours the accused is liable to be accepted, more so because there is no other direct convincingevidence (even circumstantial) against the accused.

Ahmed Sheikh Babajan & Ors,Page No. 88 of 92 decided on 24.10.2008 and State of U.P. Vs. Munni Ram & Ors. reported in 2010(12) JT 180]. Further, in the background of what has been observed as herein above, the possibilityof the other family members/ brother of the deceased equally being a part of the conspiracy tocommit the murder of the deceased cannot be ruled out.FINAL CONCLUSIONS:recorded, which are as under:1. The circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fullyestablished. The circumstances concerned 'must or should' and not 'may be'established;2. The facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guiltof the accused, that is to say, they should not be explainable on any other hypothesisexcept that the accused is guilty;3. The circumstances should be of conclusive nature and tendency;4. They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved; and5. There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for theconclusion consistent with the innocence of the St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PSMaurya Enclave Page No. 89 of 92 accused and must show that in all human probability the actState vs . Balaji Kaushal Chapre on 1 October, 2012Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/158505991/37must have been done by the accused.(98) Applying the above principles of law to the present case it is evident that the identity of theaccused Balaji Kaushal Chapre stands established. He is the father in law of the deceased M.G.Maurya Enclave that a dead body was lying at Flat No. 13, Kastoorba Residential Complex,Pitampura, Delhi pursuant to which SI Naresh along with Ct. Inderjeet reached the spot where theynoticed the dead body of a M.G. Dekate lying with multiple injuries marks. It also stands establishedthat there were as many as 13 injuries on the dead body and the cause of death was combined effectinjuries to kidney, intestines and sacrotun and mode of death was homicidal. It further standsestablished that the postmortem examination was got conducted on 15.10.2008 at 3:45 PM therebyproving that the death of the deceased would have been caused between 3:45 AM to 4:00 AM on13.10.2008.(99) However, it does not stand established that the accused Balaji Kaushal Chapre had committedthe murder of his son in law M.G. Dekate by causing injuries to him with the help of a St. Vs. BalajiKaushal Chapre, FIR No.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 90 of 92 knife. It has also not beenestablished that the accused Balaji Kaushal caused certain evidence i.e. blood stained knife whichwas used in the offence and clothes which he was wearing at the time of incident and connected withthe said offence, to disappear by throwing them in a river with intention to screen himself from legalpunishment. The weapon of offence i.e. the knife has not been recovered and the prosecution hasnot been able to connect the clothes so recovered by the accused Balaji Kaushal to the offence. Eventhe FSL report does not connect the accused with the commission of offence.(100) In view of the above I hereby hold that the circumstances reflected from the material onrecord do not stand conclusively established. The facts are also are not consistent only with thehypothesis of the guilt of the accused. The chain of evidence is not so much complete so as not toleave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the guilt of the accused person. Thematerials brought on record by the prosecution are insufficient so as to hold that the accused BalajiKaushal Chapre was guilty beyond reasonable doubt. Further, each circumstance has not beenproved beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecution has also not established a conclusive linkconnecting each individual circumstance with the other, and the accused Balaji Kaushal Chapre.Crucially, the material and evidence on the record do not bridge the gap between "may be true" andmust be true" so essential for a court to record a finding of St. Vs. Balaji Kaushal Chapre, FIRNo.23/2008, PS Maurya Enclave Page No. 91 of 92 guilt of an accused, particularly in cases basedon circumstantial evidence. Therefore, I hereby hold that the prosecution has not been able to proveand substantiate the allegations against the accused Balaji Kaushal Chapre, beyond reasonabledoubt and hence, benefit of doubt is being given to him who is acquitted of the charges underSection 302/201 Indian Penal Code. The accused be released if not wanted in any other case.(101)                File be consigned to Record Room.State vs .
