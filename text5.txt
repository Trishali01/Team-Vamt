State of Punjab & Ors.                                           ...Respondents            CORAM: HON'BLE MR.JUSTICE MEHINDER SINGH SULLAR            Present:-          Mr.Varinder Pal Singh Mithewal, Advocate for the petitioner.                               Mr.Rajat Bansal, AAG Punjab for respondent No.1.                               Nemo for respondent Nos.2 and 3.            Mehinder Singh Sullar, J. (Oral)The matrix of the facts and material, which needs a necessary mention for the limited purpose ofdeciding the core controversy, involved in the instant petition and emanating from the record, isthat initially, in the wake of statement of complainant Balwinder Singh s/o Gurcharan Singh(respondent No.2) (for brevity "the complainant"), with respect to kidnapping of his daughterKuldeep Kaur (respondent No.3), a criminal case was registered against petitioner-accused JagvirSingh alias Sonu son of Surinder Singh alias Chhinder, vide FIR No.161 dated 14.10.2013 (AnnexureP1) on accusation of having committed the offences punishable u/ss 363 and 366-A IPC by thepolice of Police Station Machhiwara, Police District Khanna, District Ludhiana.2. During the course of investigation of the criminal case, good sense prevailed and the parties haveamicably settled their disputes, by means of affidavit/compromise dated 13.3.2014 (Annexure P-2).3. Having compromised the matter, the petitioner-accused has preferred the present petition, toquash the impugned FIR (Annexure P-1) ARVIND SHARMA 2015.01.07 17:10 I attest to theaccuracy and integrity of this document Chandigarh and all other subsequent proceedings arisingtherefrom, invoking the provisions of Section 482 Cr.PC, inter-alia, pleading that now with theintervention of friends, elders and respectables of society, the parties have amicably settled theirdisputes, by way of indicated affidavit/compromise (Annexure P2). They belong to the same area.They have redressed their grievances, have no grudge against each other and will lead peaceful lifein future. The complainant has accepted the marriage of his daughter Kuldeep Kaur with petitionerJagvir Singh and now they are peacefully residing as husband & wife in her matrimonial home. Thecomplainant and victim have no objection if the criminal case registered against the petitioner, byvirtue of impugned FIR is quashed. On the strength of aforesaid grounds, the petitioner sought toquash the impugned FIR (Annexure P-1) and all other consequent proceedings arising thereto in themanner depicted here-in- above.4. During the course of preliminary hearing, the Area Magistrate was directed to record thestatements of all the concerned parties, with regard to the genuineness and validity or otherwise ofJagvir Singh vs State Of Punjab &Anr; on 7 January, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53026969/1the affidavit/compromise (Annexure P-2) between them, by means of order dated 24.3.2014 by aCoordinate Bench (T.P.S.Mann, J.) of this Court.5. In compliance thereof, the Magistrate, having recorded the statements of all the concernedparties, has reported, vide his report dated 13.5.2014 that the compromise is voluntarily, genuineand without any pressure, undue influence or coercion.6. In this manner, once it stands proved on record that respondent No.3 has performed the marriageand now she is residing with the petitioner as his wife in her matrimonial home, then, no offencespunishable u/ss 363 ARVIND SHARMA 2015.01.07 17:10 I attest to the accuracy and integrity ofthis document Chandigarh and 366-A IPC are made out against the petitioner, in view of ratio of lawlaid down by Hon'ble Apex Court in cases Prashant Bharti v. State of NCT of Delhi 2013(3) RCR(Criminal) 399, Indra Sarma v. V.K.V.Sarma 2014 (1) RCR (Criminal) 179 and Lata Singh v. State ofUP and another 2006 (5) SCC 475. Therefore, the parties are well within their legal right to settle thematter on the basis of compromise.7. An identical question came to be decided by this court in a recent judgment in case Gian Sarup v.State of Punjab, 2013(4) RCR (Criminal) 183, wherein having considered the scope of offences, inquestion, it was ruled as under (paras 20 & 21) :-"20. A conjoint and meaningful reading of sections 361, 363 and 366 IPC wouldreveal that in order to attract these provisions, the prosecution was required to proveby producing cogent evidence on record that the appellant has actually taken orenticed away or induced the prosecutrix with intent that she may be compelled tomarry her. Actual taking or enticing away a minor out of the keeping of the lawfulguardian are the essential ingredients of the offence of kidnaping. The word "takes"no doubt means physical taking not necessarily means by use of force or fraud. If thetwo words "taking or enticing" carrying a very significant meaning, are read together,would suggest that if the minor leaves her parental home completely uninfluenced byany promise, offer or inducement, then the accused cannot be considered to havecommitted the offence of kidnapping. In other words, in case the minor herselfabandoned the guardianship, in the absence of any evidence of taking or enticing orblandishments and left her father's protection knowing and having capacity to knowthe full import of what she was doing voluntarily joined the appellant, perhaps it willnot invite the application of the provisions of kidnapping.21. That means, if the prosecution fails to prove that immediately prior to the minor leaving thefather's protection no active part was played by the accused, he had at some earlier stage solicited orpersuaded the minor to do so, then, it would not be legitimate to infer that he is guilty of taking theminor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian merely because after she had voluntarily left herguardian's house, joined and the accused helped her in her design not to return to her guardian'shouse by taking her along with him from place to place to facilitate and fulfill the intention of thegirl. It falls short of an inducement to the minor to slip ARVIND SHARMA out/abandon her father'sprotection will not tantamount to "taking" as 2015.01.07 17:10 I attest to the accuracy and integrityJagvir Singh vs State Of Punjab &Anr; on 7 January, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53026969/2of this document Chandigarh contemplated u/s 361 IPC. Reliance in this regard can be placed to acelebrated judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in case S.Varadarajan v. State of Madras 1965 AIR (SC)942, which was subsequently followed in various judgments."8. What cannot possibly be disputed here is that the law with regard to quashing of criminalprosecution on the basis of compromise is no more res integra and is now well-settled. The Hon'bleSupreme Court in case Gian Singh v. State of Punjab and another, 2012 (4) RCR (Criminal) 543 hasinterpreted the relevant provisions and considered a line of the judgments on the indicated pointsand it was ruled (para 57) as under:-"57. The position that emerges from the above discussion can be summarised thus:the power of the High Court in quashing a criminal proceeding or FIR or complaintin exercise of its inherent jurisdiction is distinct and different from the power given toa criminal court for compounding the offences under Section 320 of the Code.Inherent power is of wide plenitude with no statutory limitation but it has to beexercised in accord with the guideline engrafted in such power viz; (i) to secure theends of justice or (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of any Court. In what casespower to quash the criminal proceeding or complaint or F.I.R. may be exercisedwhere the offender and victim have settled their dispute would depend on the factsand circumstances of each case and no category can be prescribed. However, beforeexercise of such power, the High Court must have due regard to the nature andgravity of the crime. Heinous and serious offences of mental depravity or offenceslike murder, rape, dacoity, etc. cannot be fittingly quashed even though the victim orvictim's family and the offender have settled the dispute. Such offences are notprivate in nature and have serious impact on society.Similarly, any compromise between the victim and offender in relation to the offences under specialstatutes like Prevention of Corruption Act or the offences committed by public servants whileworking in that capacity etc., cannot provide for any basis for quashing criminal proceedingsinvolving such offences. But the criminal cases having overwhelmingly and pre-dominatingly civilflavour stand on different footing for the purposes of quashing, particularly the offences arisingfrom commercial, financial, mercantile, civil, partnership or such like transactions or the offencesarising out of matrimony relating to dowry etc. or the family disputes where the wrong is basicallyprivate or personnel in nature and the parties have resolved their entire dispute. In this category ofcases, High Court may quash criminal proceedings if in its view, because of the compromise betweenthe offender and victim, the possibility of conviction is remote and bleak and ARVIND SHARMAcontinuation of criminal case would put accused to great oppression and 2015.01.07 17:10 I attest tothe accuracy and integrity of this document Chandigarh prejudice and extreme injustice would becaused to him by not quashing the criminal case despite full and complete settlement andcompromise with the victim. In other words, the High Court must consider whether it would beunfair or contrary to the interest of justice to continue with the criminal proceeding or continuationof the criminal proceeding would tantamount to abuse of process of law despite settlement andcompromise between the victim and wrongdoer and whether to secure the ends of justice, it isappropriate that criminal case is put to an end and if the answer to the above question(s) is inJagvir Singh vs State Of Punjab &Anr; on 7 January, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53026969/3affirmative, the High Court shall be well within its jurisdiction to quash the criminal proceeding."9. Sequelly, the same view was reiterated by the Hon'ble Apex Court in case Narinder Singh & othersv. State of Punjab & Anr. 2014 (2) RCR (Criminal) 482.10. Meaning thereby, it stands proved on record that the parties have amicably settled theirdisputes, by means of affidavit/compromise (Annexure P2) and the pointed report of theMagistrate.11. Such thus being the legal position and material on record, now the short & significant question,though important, which invites an immediate attention of this Court and arises for determinationin this petition, is as to whether the impugned FIR deserves to be quashed on the basis ofcompromise or not?12. Having regard to the contentions of the learned counsel, to my mind, it would be in the interestand justice would be sub-served if the impugned FIR is quashed. Moreover, the learned counsel aread idem that, in view of the settlement of disputes between the parties, the instant petition deservesto be accepted in this context.13. As is evident from the record that now with the intervention of friends, elders and respectables ofsociety, the parties have amicably settled their disputes, by way of indicated affidavit/compromise(Annexure P2). They belong to the same area. They have redressed their grievances, have ARVINDSHARMA 2015.01.07 17:10 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document Chandigarh nogrudge against each other and will lead peaceful life in future. The complainant has accepted themarriage of his daughter Kuldeep Kaur with petitioner Jagvir Singh and now they are peacefullyresiding as husband & wife in her matrimonial home. The complainant and victim have no objectionif the criminal case registered against the petitioner, by virtue of impugned FIR is quashed. In thateventuality, the question of commission of indicated offences by the petitioner did not at all ariseunder the present set of circumstances. Thus, the registration of the impugned FIR by thecomplainant amounts to deep misuse/abuse of process of law and deserves to be quashed, in view ofthe law laid down by Hon'ble Supreme Court in case State of Haryana and others v. Ch.Bhajan Laland others AIR 1992 Supreme Court 604, which was again reiterated in case Som Mittal v.Government of Karnataka 2008(2) R.C.R.(Criminal) 92. The Bench mark for quashing the criminalprosecution as set out in the aforesaid judgments "mutatis mutandis" is fully applicable to the factsof the present case and is the complete answer to the problem in hand.14. Therefore, there is no impediment in translating their wishes into reality and to quash thecriminal prosecution to set the matter at rest, to enable them to live in peace and to enjoy the lifeand liberty in a dignified manner. Otherwise also, if the present prosecution is allowed to continue,then it will inculcate and perpetuate injustice to the petitioner and adversely affect the matrimonialrelationship of petitioner and respondent No.3 as husband & wife, which, to me, is not legallypermissible in this relevant connection.Jagvir Singh vs State Of Punjab &Anr; on 7 January, 2015Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/53026969/415. No other legal point, worth consideration, has either been urged or pressed by the counsel for theparties.ARVIND SHARMA 2015.01.07 17:10 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this documentChandigarh16. In the light of aforesaid reasons, the instant petition is accepted. Consequently, the impugnedFIR (Annexure P1) & all other subsequent proceedings arising therefrom are hereby quashed andthe petitioner is discharged from the pointed criminal case on the basis of compromise, subject to alljust exceptions.17. Needless to mention that in case, the petitioner fails to maintain and nicely keep respondentNo.3 as his wife, then, the criminal prosecution would be deemed to have been automatically revivedand prosecution/complainant would be at liberty to prosecute him for the indicated offences.
