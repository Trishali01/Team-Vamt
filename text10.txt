The legal machinery has been set into motion by PW-3 Swaran Singh, father of the prosecutrix,vide his statement Ex.PF dated 21.5.2001 recorded by PW-6 SI Dalbir Singh wherein he alleged thathe is having five children. That yesterday evening, as usual their family members went to sleep inthe courtyard of their house after taking the meal. That on 21.5.2001, in the morning at about 3 A.M,he got up to supply fodder to the cattle and found that the prosecutrix, his daughter aged about14-15 years, was not present on her cot. He searched for his daughter here and there but she couldnot be traced. On making enquiry, he came to know that appellant-Subeg Singh was also missingfrom his house from the night. He has enticed away his daughter. When he was going to report thematter along with Bhag Singh, Member Panchayat SI Balbir Singh met him and recorded hisstatement PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of thisdocument High Court Chandigarh Ex.PF on the basis of which the formal FIR Ex.PF/3 wasregistered. On 22.5.2001, complainant-Swaran Singh made the supplementary statement allegingtherein that appellant-Sarabjit Kaur and her husband Buta Singh in furtherance of their commonintention have forcibly enticed away his daughter.3. The investigation was carried out. The Investigating Officer searched for the prosecutrix and theaccused. Ultimately, the prosecutrix along with accused appellant-Subeg Singh was apprehended on29.5.2001 at Bus Stand Patran. The statement of the prosecutrix was got recorded by theInvestigating Officer under Section 164 Cr.P.C wherein she levelled the allegations for havingcommitting rape upon her by appellant-Subeg Singh and that she was forcibly taken away byappellant-Subeg Singh to Amritsar and Kurukshetra where she was forced to wear new clothes andChura and was compelled to have the photographs. She stated that Subeg Singh had taken her awaywithout her consent and deceitfully. On the basis of the statement of the prosecutrix, offencepunishable under Section 376 IPC was added. The prosecutrix as well as accused Subeg Singh weregot medically examined. Appellant Subeg Singh was arrested in this case on 29.5.2001. AppellantsSarbjit Kaur and Buta Singh was arrested on 7.6.2001 and on completion of the investigation, thereport under Section 173 Cr.P.C was presented in the Court.4. The case was committed to the Court of Sessions for trial by the learned Judicial Magistrate,Samana vide order dated 7.9.2001.Subeg Singh And Ors vs State Of Punjab on 24 December, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45259137/25. All the three appellants were chargesheeted for the offences PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.3111:51 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document High Court Chandigarh punishableunder Sections 363, 366 and 506 read with Section 34 IPC. Appellant Subeg Singh was alsochargesheeted for the offence punishable under Section 376 IPC. They were also chargesheeted forthe offence punishable under Section 120-B IPC vide order dated 17.9.2001 to which they pleadednot guilty and claimed trial.6. In order to substantiate its case, the prosecution examined as many as nine witnesses. The reportof the Chemical Examiner Ex.PK was also tendered into evidence.7. When examined under Section 313 Cr.P.C, all the three appellants pleaded that the prosecutrixwas major. She performed marriage on her own accord and voluntarily with appellant Subeg Singh.Thereafter, her parents started raising demand of Rs. 50,000. The prosecutrix also joined them. Thesaid demand was not fulfilled by the appellants that is why this false case was instituted. The parentsof the prosecutrix solemnised her second marriage with Gurjit Singh son of Joginder Singh residentof village Nissing, Distt. Karnal. The prosecutrix has also got registered a case under Section 294 IPCagainst Surjit Singh and Gurbinder Singh of village Nissing and raised the demand of money forwithdrawing that case. She is habitual of lodging false cases and demanding money. They areinnocent.8. In the defence evidence, the accused appellants examined Lakhwinder Singh resident of villageNissing as DW-1 and Harbhajan Singh also resident of village Nissing as DW-2.9. On appreciating the evidence on record and the contentions raised by the learned counsel for theparties, the learned trial Court PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this document High Court Chandigarh vide impugned judgment held guilty andconvicted the appellants for the offences mentioned in the opening paragraph of the judgment andthey were awarded the sentence as mentioned above.10. Aggrieved with the aforesaid judgment of conviction and order of sentence, the present appealhas been preferred.11. I have heard Sh.Harmanjit Singh Thiara, learned counsel for the appellants and Sh.JashanpreetSingh, learned Assistant Advocate General for the State of Punjab and have meticulously perusedthe record.12. Initiating the arguments learned counsel for the appellants contended that the prosecutrix wasmajor on the date of occurrence. The prosecution has not produced any evidence to establish thatshe was below 18 years of age. Even the medical evidence produced by the prosecution shows thatshe was above 17 years of age. There is always variation of two years in the age assessed on the basisof medical evidence and the favourable view to the accused should be taken. In this manner, theprosecutrix is proved to be a major on the date of occurrence.Subeg Singh And Ors vs State Of Punjab on 24 December, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45259137/313. He further contended that the prosecutrix was a consenting party. She has solemnised themarriage with appellant Subeg Singh. The story of the prosecution is highly improbable that theprosecutrix could be forcibly kidnapped in such a manner at the dead hours of the night. She hastravelled with appellant Subeg Singh to Amritsar and Kurukshetra in public transport. She stayedwith him for about nine days but no alarm was raised at any point of time. She also did not sufferany PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this documentHigh Court Chandigarh injury on any part of her body. She went to the Gurudwara Sahib withappellant Subeg Singh in order to solemnise marriage. The floral garlands are visible in thephotographs Ex.D2 to D5. Even the photographs show that the prosecutrix was in happy mood anddoes not seems to be under any pressure. The prosecutrix has admitted that accused was not havingany weapon. The version of the prosecutrix that she was threatened and forced to accompanyappellant Subeg Singh and solemnised the marriage does not inspire any confidence. Thus, hepleaded that as the prosecutrix was a consenting party so, no offence of kidnapping and rape ismade out. To support his contentions, he has relied upon cases Bibhishan versus State ofMaharashtra 2007(4) RCR (Criminal) 469, Jamil Ahmad versus State of Haryana 2011(3) RCR(Criminal) 385, Sagar Kumar versus State of Haryana 2011 (1) RCRA (Criminal) 620, Bhira Singhand another versus State of Haryana 2007(4) RCR (Criminal) 924, Sumer Singh versus State ofRajasthan 1998(1) RLW 204, Bhagwati and others versus State of Rajasthan 1989(2) RajasthanLR296 and Ram Bahadur versus State of Rajasthan 2004(2) RajCriC 1083.14. On the other hand, learned Assistant Advocate General for the State of Punjab contended that asper the statements of Swaran Singh-complainant, the father of the prosecutrix and the prosecutrixherself, she was below 16 years of age at the time of the occurrence. She was a teenager and illiteratevillage girl. She was threatened and forced to accompany Subeg Singh-appellant. The girl of such aage can be easily allured, so, it cannot be stated that she has voluntarily and PUSHPINDER SAINI2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document High Court Chandigarhwillingly accompanied appellant-Subeg Singh and had sexual relation with him. He furthercontended that the prosecutrix has repeatedly deposed that she could not raise alarm as she wasunder threat. She was even forced to pose in the photographs of the fake marriage. Thus, he pleadedthat the conviction of the appellants has been rightly recorded by the learned trial Court.15. I have duly considered the aforesaid contentions. In the cases of sexual offences, it is incumbentupon the prosecution to establish the age of the prosecutrix because the age of the prosecutrix is avital issue to determine the culpability. In the instant case, the Investigating Officer has notcollected any evidence to establish the age of the prosecutrix. PW-3 Swaran Singh has not at alldeposed the age of the prosecutrix in his examination-in-chief. In the cross examination, he statedthat he was married 20-22 years ago. He cannot tell the age of his children. However, he has deniedthe suggestion that the age of the prosecutrix is 20-21 years. Then there is a statement of theprosecutrix recorded by the learned trial Court on 10.10.2002. In her statement, she has mentionedher age to be 15/16 years. In the cross examination, she deposed that she does not know the age ofher elder sister. She was married 4-5 years ago. She further stated that she does not know how manyyears she was younger to her elder sister. PW-5 Dr. Alkesh Arora has medico legally examined theprosecutrix on 29.5.2001. He proved the copy of the Medico Legal Report Ex.PW-5/A. In the MedicoLegal Report, the age of the prosecutrix has been mentioned as 17 years. In the cross examination,Subeg Singh And Ors vs State Of Punjab on 24 December, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45259137/4this witness deposed PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy and integrity ofthis document High Court Chandigarh that the age mentioned in the Medico Legal Report wasdisclosed by the girl herself. He further deposed that she can be more than 17 or around 18 years ofage.16. PW-6 SI Balbir Singh, the Investigating Officer of the case, has also deposed that the doctor hasgiven the opinion that age of the prosecutrix was above 17 years. Then there is a statement of PW-7Dr. Garja Singh, Medical Officer. He deposed that on 31.5.2001, two applications were presentedbefore him which are Ex.PW-6/B and PW- 6/C. The first application was for seeking opinion aboutthe age of the prosecutrix. Thereupon, he has given opinion that upon medical approximation, herage was 17 years. He proved his opinion to this effect Ex.PW-6/B1. This is the evidence adduced bythe prosecution and the prosecution cannot wriggle out from the evidence produced by it on thepoint of the age of the prosecutrix. As per statements of PW-5 Dr. Alkesh Arora, PW-6 SI BalbirSingh, the Investigating Officer of the case and PW-7 Dr. Garja Singh, the age of the prosecutrix was17 or above 17 years. PW-7 Dr. Garja Singh has stated in his cross examination that the age of theprosecutrix may fluctuate one year on the either side.17. As per the testimonies of the doctor witnesses, the age of the prosecutrix as per the medicalapproximation was 17 or above.18. In the defence evidence, the accused have brought on record the copy of the statement of theprosecutrix dated 25.07.2002 recorded by the police of Police Station Nissing. In that statement, theprosecutrix has mentioned her age as 24/25 years. PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest tothe accuracy and integrity of this document High Court Chandigarh19. It is settled principle of law that such variation favourable to the accused should be taken intoconsideration. In this manner, the age of the prosecutrix comes to about 18 years or above. Thus, theprosecutrix was major at the time of the occurrence.20. The version of the prosecutrix that she was forcibly taken away and compelled to accompanyappellant-Subeg Singh is highly improbable. As per her testimony, on the night intervening20/21.5.2001 she woke up at about 12 o'clock/1 AM to urinate. Appellant-Sarabjit Kaur wasstanding along with the side of the wall of their house adjoining to their house. She asked her tolisten her for two minutes. She called her to her house. She honoured her desire and went to herhouse. She found their parents, Buta Singh and Subeg Singh. Sarabjit Kaur asked her forengagement with Subeg Singh. She refused. She further deposed that when she was about to standup for leaving their house, all the three caught hold of her from her arms and started giving herthreats. They said that if she would not volunteer for marriage she would be married forcibly withSubeg Singh. Thereafter, she deposed that all the three accused by catching her hold took her to themettaled road. Sarbjit Kaur-appellant threatened her that if she would not go with Subeg Singh shewould be done to death. Thereafter, Sarbjit Kaur and Buta Singh returned. Subeg Singh took her tothe agricultural field by catching her from her arms. She kept mum being scared of. He took her 4-5killas deep into the agricultural field and forcibly committed rape upon her. Thereafter, she deposedthat she was taken by appellant- Subeg Singh to bus stand Patran. They boarded the bus went toSubeg Singh And Ors vs State Of Punjab on 24 December, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45259137/5PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document HighCourt Chandigarh Amritsar and stayed there for 3-4 days in some village. Then they came toKurukshetra at the house of the relative of appellant-Subeg Singh. Sarbjit Kaur and Buta Singh werealso present there and they asked her to marry Subeg Singh. She refused to marry Subeg Singh.They said that if she would not marry him, her marriage would be forcibly performed with him.Thereafter, she was made to wear new clothes and Chura. Her photographs were taken with SubegSingh. All this was done against her wishes. She was kept for 4-5 days in Kurukshetra and then theycame to Bus Stand Patran where they were apprehended by the police.21. The story putforward by the prosecutrix that she was compelled and forced to accompany Subegand to marry him is highly improbable and unreliable. There are number of circumstances on recordwhich show that she has voluntarily and willingly accompanied Subeg Singh. It is the admittedversion of the prosecutrix that she and appellants are neighbours. Only small walls separate theircourtyards. They were on visiting terms. As per the version of the prosecutrix, on the night of theoccurrence she was sleeping on the bed near her parents, brother and sister. She got up at about 12o'clock/1 AM in the night to urinate. It is alleged that appellant-Sarbjit Kaur was standing by theside of the wall. This version is highly improbable as accused Sarbjit Kaur could have no knowledgethat prosecutrix will woke up and come outside of her house to urinate at that point of time. It isalso not expected that accused Sarbjit Kaur will keep waiting by the side of the wall of the house totake a chance that the prosecutrix may come out of PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest tothe accuracy and integrity of this document High Court Chandigarh her house. Thus, this versionthat appellant-Sarbjit Kaur was present by the side of the wall of their house and took her away totheir house is not believable at all rather it shows that she voluntarily left her house in the night andwent to the house of the appellants. The family members of the prosecutrix were sleeping nearby so,it is not believable that she could be taken away in this manner to her house by appellant-SarabjitKaur. It is also highly improbable that she will accompany Sarbjit Kaur- appellant at the dead hoursof the night to her house knowing fully well that she was pressurising and compelling her to marrySubeg Singh and have sexual relation with him and her intentions were not fair. It is also notbelievable that appellant-Sarbjit Kaur would have chosen the dead hours of the night to persuadethe prosecutrix to have engagement and marry with her brother-in-law (Devar) appellant-SubegSingh.22. It is also not believable that when the prosecutrix refused to obey the dictates of the appellants,she was caught hold by them and taken to the metalled road from their house. In the dead hours ofthe night, even a slight noise is audible but this action of the appellants did not attract anyneighbourer or inhabitant of the locality. The prosecutrix has also not raised any alarm when shewas being forcibly taken away by the appellants even though her house adjoins the house of theaccused and her family members were present therein, in such a situation, it would have been thenatural reaction of the prosecutrix to raise alarm so that their family members are attracted and shecould be saved.PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document HighCourt ChandigarhSubeg Singh And Ors vs State Of Punjab on 24 December, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45259137/623. It is also not believable that appellant-Subeg Singh could have carried the prosecutrix in theagricultural field to the distance of 4- 5 killas from the metalled road on foot by catching theprosecutrix from her arms. The prosecutrix is well built girl as per the medical evidence and couldnot be overpowered in this manner. The prosecutrix has alleged that appellant-Subeg Singh hadbroken the string of her salwar and committed rape upon her. The said broken string has not beenproduced before the police. Moreover, the prosecutrix had stated that she was not having any otherdress. If the string of her salwar was broken, then how she could have tied the salwar around herwaist.24. Thereafter, the prosecutrix had accompanied appellant- Subeg to Bus Stand Patran on foot andby that time, it was 5 AM. It is a fact of common knowledge that in the villages, the people rises earlyfor going to the fields to do the agriculture work. It is not believable that at such point of time,appellant-Subeg Singh could have forcibly carried the prosecutrix to the bus stand, a public place.The prosecutrix has further admitted that from Bus Stand Patran, they boarded the bus and went toAmritsar, situated at a long distance. She further admitted that they stayed in a village for 3-4 daysand then, she accompanied appellant0-Subeg to Kurukshetra. This time again they travelledthrough the public transport but at no point of time, the prosecutrix tried to escape or raise alarm. Itis not the case of the prosecutrix that she was kept confined at Amritsar or Kurukshetra where shehad resided for about 8-9 days.25. As per the admission of the prosecutrix, she wore the new PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document High Court Chandigarh clothes and Churaand accompanied Subeg Singh to the Gurudwara Sahib for marriage. The learned trial Court hasheld that the marriage between the prosecutrix and accused Subeg Singh was not solemnised as perthe Sikh rites. The validity of the marriage between the accused and the prosecutrix is not to bedecided in this case but the conduct of the prosecutrix accompanying appellant-Subeg to theGurudwara Sahib, exchanging the floral garlands and posing for the joint photograph are verysignificant events to show that she was a consenting party. The Gurudwara is a public place andvarious persons might be present their. Similarly, Amritsar and Kurukshetra are also the big cities.The presence of number of public persons and even the police officials is natural but at no point oftime, she lodged any protest that she was being forcibly kept or taken away by the appellants rathershe has admitted in the cross examination that she did not disclose anything to any person presentat the bus stand or while travelling in the bus. It appears that the prosecutrix had returned toPartran along with appellant-Subeg when Saudagar Singh, father of appellant-Subeg Singh, came tothem and told that police was making the search for them and he suggested that they should go toPatran. This is another significant fact to show that she only returned to Patran on the advice ofSaudagar Singh, the father of appellant-Subeg Singh that the police was searching for them. Again,she came to Patran along with appellant-Subeg in a bus.26. As per the medical evidence, the prosecutrix did not suffer any injury on any part of her body. Inthe cross examination, she PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attest to the accuracy andintegrity of this document High Court Chandigarh admitted that she did not suffer any abrasion onher body. She also admitted that the accused was not having any weapon. So, the theory of threatand criminal intimidation projected by the prosecutrix totally collapses. Thus, all the aforesaidSubeg Singh And Ors vs State Of Punjab on 24 December, 2014Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/45259137/7circumstances, mentioned above, establish that the prosecutrix has willingly and voluntarily elopedwith appellant-Subeg Singh. She was major at the time of the occurrence and was a consentingparty.27. In case Dharmender and others versus State of Haryana 2010 (3) RCR (Criminal) 179, theprosecutrix was 17 years of age. This Court held that she had knowledge and capacity of having fullimport of what she was doing. Accused was not guilty of taking her away from the keeping of thelawful guardianship and she was a consenting party. In case Vinod versus The State of Haryana2010 (3) RCR (Criminal) 309, the prosecutrix was a minor girl of 16 years of age. It was found thatshe went to meet the accused and accompanied him to various places and performed marriage withhim. The prosecutrix was mature enough to decide between her good and bad. This Court held thatthe essential ingredients constituting the offence of kidnapping was not made out. The same legalposition has been reiterated in case Sukh Ram versus State of Haryana 2010 (4) RCR (Criminal)875. In that case, the prosecutrix was 16 years and eight months of age. Reliance can also be placedupon case Anil Kumar @ Sunil versus State of Haryana 2010 (6) RCR (Criminal) 814. In caseBahadur Ali versus State of Punjab and others 2011 (3) RCR (Criminal) 380, the prosecutrix wastaken to Kalka in a bus where sexual intercourse was PUSHPINDER SAINI 2014.12.31 11:51 I attestto the accuracy and integrity of this document High Court Chandigarh committed. This Court heldthat prosecutrix was a consenting party as she was taken by the accused on the bus. She hadsufficient opportunity to raise hue and cry but she did not do so. Even from the medical evidence noforce used against her was proved. In case Alamelu and another versus State Represented byInspector of Police 2011 (1) RCR (Criminal) 489, the prosecutrix stayed with accused for six days.She did not make any complaint on so many occasions when she had opportunity to do so. She alsohad opportunity to run away but she did not. She married the accused in a temple. The Hon'bleSupreme Court held that version of the prosecution that accused forcibly abducted the prosecutrixand committed sexual intercourse with her was not believable. In case Avdesh versus The State ofHaryana 2010 (4) RCR (Criminal) 154, no weapon was shown to the prosecutrix by the accusedwhile threatening. She travelled with him in a bus. She had many occasions to raise alarm but shekept mum. There was no mark of external injury on her person. She was held to be a consentingparty. The similar ratio of law has been laid down in the cases relied upon by the learned counsel forthe appellants.28. Thus, keeping in view my aforesaid discussion, there is no escape from the conclusion that theprosecutrix was a consenting party. She voluntarily and willingly eloped with appellant-SubegSingh. The prosecution has not been able to establish that she was below 18 years of age at the timeof the occurrence. Consequently, the prosecution has failed to establish its case beyond shadow ofreasonable doubt against all the appellants. They deserve the benefit of doubt.
