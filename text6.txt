JAIN, J.Jamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/11. These are two criminal appeals arising out of the judgment dated 29th May, 1999 and the Orderon Sentence dated 31 st May, 1999 whereby both the appellants were convicted under section 366 ofIPC read with section 34 thereof and under section 376 of IPC. Both the appellants were sentencedto undergo RI for 4 years and to pay fine of Rs.2000/- each or to undergo SI for 2 months each indefault under section 366 of IPC read with section 34 thereof. They were further sentenced toundergo RI for 7 years each and to pay fine of Rs.3000/- each or to undergo SI for 3 months each indefault under section 376 of IPC. The sentences were directed to run concurrently.2. The FIR in this case was lodged by deceased Prabhu Dayal, father of the prosecutrix. He allegedthat he had two children one son and one daughter, the son being elder. He further stated that hisdaughter, who had gone to house of her friend in Noida on 24th November, 1989, informed hercousin Satish Anand on 25th November, 1989 that she would be going to Pragati Maidan to visit theexhibition being held there and that he should come there to pick her up from Ahmad Food Stall,where Mohd. Imran Khan and Jamal Ahmed were working. He further alleged that when SatishAnand went to Ahmad Food Stall in Pragati Maidan, neither the prosecutrix nor the appellantMohd. Imran Khan and Jamal Ahmed met him. He further alleged that he was informed that theprosecutrix was seen in the exhibition ground along with the appellants and was to come back homein evening. When she did not come back till evening he went to Pragati Maidan on 26th November,1989 and came to know that his daughter was seen with the appellants. He also informed that in theyear 1988 he had put up a stall in Pragati Maidan, in front of a shop in which the appellants wereworking and that his wife Devki and his daughter also used to visit the stall for helping him. Hefurther informed that a missing report was lodged by him at PS Vinay Nagar on 27th November,1989.3. The prosecutrix came in the witness box as PW 3 and stated that on 25.11.1989 she had gone toPragati Maidan as her cousin Satish Anand had to pick her up from there. On reaching PragatiMaidan at about 1.30 P.M. she did not find her cousin at gate No.1 where he was supposed to meether. She kept looking for him for about 2-3 hours, but did not find him. She further stated that shehad told her brother to meet her at Ahmad Food Stall and since she did not find him at gate No.1,she went to Ahmad Food Stall, where both the appellants met her. They were already known to heras her father had put up a stall in Pragati Maidan in the year 1988, opposite the stall of theappellant. She further stated that the appellants told her that her brother was waiting for her at thegate and took her to gate No.3. The moment they came out they whipped out a knife and told herthat in case she tried to run away and raised alarm, they would kill her. She was forcibly taken bythem to ISBT, in a three wheeler scooter, and from there she was taken to Merrut by a bus. InMerrut she was taken to hotel Ajanta and both the accused raped her in room No.101 of the hotel. Inthe morning she was taken to the house of their sister and from there she was brought back to Delhito the house of elder brother of appellant Jamal. There also she was raped by both the appellants inthe night. On 27th November, 1989 they locked her inside the house and went away. They returnedin the evening and again committed rape on her. In the evening of 28th November, 1989 theappellant Jamal Ahmed came along with elder brother and brother in law of Mohd. Imran Khan andleft her in their custody. They took her to Pragati Maidan and from there she was taken to a flatbehind G.B. Pant Hospital where both the appellants were present. After some time the policearrived there and recovered her. Her underwear P1 was seized by the police. She was producedJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/2before a Magistrate where her statement Ex.F3/A was recorded.4. PW 7 Dr. R.K. Sharma, CMO, NDMC has proved the Birth Certificate Ex.PW7/A prepared by hisstaff and signed by him at point A. During cross-examination he admitted that another BirthCertificate Ex.PW7/DA was also signed by him. PW 9 Vijay Kumar is the Medical Record Officer ofthe Safdarjung Hospital who brought the original birth register dated 2 nd September, 1974 andstated that as per the birth register there was entry regarding birth of a female child to Devki wife ofPrabhu Dayal on 2nd September, 1974. The copy of the birth entry is Ex.PW9/A.5. PW 12 Data Ram is the Reception Officer of Ajanta Hostel, Delhi Road, Merrut. He has stated thaton 25 th November, 1989 one Manoj had come to the hotel along with a girl. He identified theappellant Jamal Ahmed as the boy referred by him a Manoj and also produced the entry made in theregister regarding stay of Manoj and a girl Mohini. PW14 Inspector R.K. Gulia has stated that on28.11.1989 they conducted a raid at Government flat No.36/96 in G.B. Pant Hospital. Theprosecutrix was found there along with both the appellants. According to him he was taken to thathouse by Mahboob Khan, brother-in-law of the appellant Mohd. Imran Khan Khan. PW13 constableSamunder Singh has corroborated the deposition of PW14 regarding the recovery of the prosecutrix.6. In his statement under section 313 Cr.PC the appellant Jamal Ahmed denied having taken theprosecutrix with him and having raped her. He claimed that he was introduced to the prosecutrix byMohd. Imran Khan and she used to treat him as her brother. The appellant Mohd. Imran Khan alsodenied having taken the prosecutrix with him and having raped her. He has claimed that JamalAhmed used to visit his place and had introduced him to the family of the prosecutrix.7. Two witnesses have been produced in defence. DW1 M.M. Alam has stated that in the year 1989the appellant Jamal Ahmed had come to him regarding marriage of the appellant Mohd. ImranKhan with the prosecutrix who told him that she wanted to marry Mohd. Imran Khan . DW2 SayeedAkhtar is the brother-in-law of the appellant Mohd. Imran Khan . He has stated that on 27thNovember, 1989 police officials took Mohd. Imran Khan with them. DW4 Mohd. Shaqir has statedthat on 27.11.89 some police officials had taken Mohd. Imran Khan to police station from U.P.pavilion in Pragati Maidan. The appellant Mohd. Imran Khan has himself come in the witness boxas DW 5 and has stated that he had become friendly to the prosecutrix and on 25th November, 1989she met him at his residence and told her that her mother had turned her out of the house. He statedthat the prosecutrix and the appellant Jamal Ahmed went to Merrut to consult Shri Mustaq Alam,Advocate who was known to Jamal. Jamal Ahmed went to the house of the advocate along with theprosecutrix and asked him to bring his brother Zaheer, who was a friend of the advocate. He couldnot reach Bahadurgarh and came to home. Thereafter he had no contact with the prosecutrix orJamal. On 27 th November, 1989 he was arrested from his restaurant from Pragati Maidan and wastaken to the police station.8. The first issue which comes up for consideration in this case is as to what was the age of theprosecutrix on the date she is alleged to have been kidnapped and the dates she is alleged to havebeen raped. When the prosecutrix came in the witness box on 21st May, 1992, after about 2Â½ yearsof the alleged kidnapping and rape, she stated that she was aged 17 years. The documents availableJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/3on the trial court file show that the complainant Shri Prabhu Dass, father of the prosecutrix, whowas cited as a prosecution witness died, during pendency of the trial. On the summons issued to ShriPrabhu Dass as a witness for 7th May, 1996 it was reported that he had died and a copy of his deathcertificate was also submitted by his wife Devki to the police official who went for service of summonupon him. The death certificate would show that Shri Prabhu Das died on 10th November, 1995.This factual position was admitted by the learned counsel for the appellants during arguments. Itwas for these reasons that the father of the prosecutrix despite being the informant could not beproduced in the witness box.9. The mother of the prosecutrix having not been cited as a witness was not produced in the witnessbox. Obviously, while conducting investigation, the Investigating Officer could never haveanticipated that the father of the prosecutrix would die during pendency of trial and will not be ableto come into witness box. Therefore, it was not necessary for him to cite the mother of theprosecutrix as a witness, in order to prove her age. Therefore, no adverse inference can be drawnagainst the prosecution on account of non-production of the parents of the prosecutrix in thewitness box to prove her date of birth.10. As per the Birth Certificate Ex.PW7/A produced by the prosecution the date of birth of theprosecutrix was 2 nd September, 2004. The authenticity of this document has been duly proved byPW 7 Shri R.K. Sharma, CMO, NDMC who has signed this document at point 'A'. This publicdocument finds corroboration from the birth register of NDMC which was brought by PW 9 ShriVijay Kumar Harnal of Safdarjung Hospital and a true copy of the relevant entry made in thatregister is Ex.PW9/A. The particulars given in Ex.PW 9/A match those given in the certificateEx.PW7/A. Therefore, both the documents are corroborative of each other.11. The Investigating Officer who came in the witness box as PW 15, specifically stated that this BirthCertificate was given to him by the father of the prosecutrix and that he had also obtained thephotocopy of proof of the birth of the prosecutrix from Safadarjung Hospital, which is Ex. PW15/B.A perusal of Ex. PW 15/B would show birth of a female child to Smt. Devki in Safdarjung Hospitalon 2nd September, 1974. This is yet another document which corroborates the authenticity ofEx.PW 7/A and PW 9/A. The Birth Certificate Ex.PW7/A having been produced by none other thanthe father of the prosecutrix and its authenticity having been duly verified by the InvestigatingOfficer from the record of the hospital and the document finding full corroboration from the BirthRegister of NDMC, I see absolutely no reason to doubt its authenticity. As regards the certificateEx.PW 7/DA produced by the appellants and shown to PW 7 during cross-examination, I find thatthe material available on record shows that this certificate does not pertain to the birth of theprosecutrix. Though the name of the father of the child has been shown as Prabhu Dass the name ofher mother has been shown as Devi Rani in this document. A perusal of the FIR would show that thename of the mother of the prosecutirx is 'Devki' and not 'Devi Rani'. During the course of the trial ,the process issued by the court to Shri Prabhu Dass, father of the prosecutrix was received by hiswife a number of times. The summon of Prabhu Das for 8 th November, 1994 received by one Devkiand the report of the process server shows that she was the wife of Prabu Das. The summon ofPrabhu Das for 12 October, 1995 was received by Devki and as per the report of the process servershe was the wife of Prabhu Das. When the summon of Prabhu Das was issued for 7th May, 1996, itJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/4was Devki who met the process server and informed him that Prabhu Das had died and she alsohanded over a copy of the Death Certificate to the process server. Thus, there can be no doubt thatthe name of the mother of the prosecutrix was Devki and not Devi Rani. Therefore, certificateEx.PW7/DA cannot be in respect of the birth of the prosecutrix. A perusal of the FIR shows that lateShri Prabhu Das, father of the prosecutrix, had two children including the prosecutrix. Thecertificate Ex.PW 7/A filed by the prosecution shows that the woman who gave birth to the child towhich the certificate pertains had two living children on the date of registration of birth. On theother hand, the certificate Ex.PW7/DA filed by the appellants does not contain any entry regardingthe number of living children. This is yet another circumstance which shows that the certificateEx.PW7/DA does not pertain to the prosecutrix.12. There is no corroborative evidence which would assure the court that Ex.PW7/DA pertains to theprosecutrix. On the other hand, there is ample corroborative documentary evidence in the form ofEx.PW9/A and PW 15/B which gives complete assurance to the court that Ex.PW 7/A is thecertificate pertaining to the birth of the prosecutrix. Therefore, no reliance can be placed upon theBirth Certificate produced by the appellants.13. It was contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that in his cross-examination theInvestigating Officer stated that the Birth Certificate produced by the father of the prosecutrix didnot relate to the prosecutrix. In my view the arguments is based upon a complete misreading of thedeposition of the Investigating Officer. The sentence relied upon by the learned counsel for theappellants has been picked up by him out of the context and a careful examination of the entirestatement of the Investigating Officer would show that in his examination-in-chief he hasspecifically stated that the certificate Ex.PW7/A giving the date of birth of the prosecutrix as 2ndSeptember, 1974 was verified by him from Safdarjung Hospital vide Ex.PW15/B. His deposition inthe cross- examination to the effect that the Birth Certificate of the prosecution did not relate to herand that he did not verify about the Birth Certificate from NDMC, obviously refers to PW7/DAwhich the appellants claim to be the Birth Certificate of the prosecutrix. In his cross-examinationthe Investigating Officer also stated that he had submitted before the court, at the time of hearing ofthe bail application, that the Birth Certificate was genuine but did not relate to the prosecutrix.Obviously, he would not be saying so in respect of the Birth Certificate which he himself filed withthe charge sheet and authenticity of which he himself had verified from Safdargjung Hospital videEx.PW15/B. It appears that during arguments on the bail application the appellants relied uponEx.PW7/DA, and it was in respect of this document that the Investigating Officer submitted beforethe court that though the document was genuine, it did not relate to the prosecutrix. Hence, I amsatisfied that Ex.PW7/DA does not pertain to the birth of the prosecutrix and Ex.PW7/A is hergenuine Birth Certificate issued by NDMC. As per the Birth Certificate Ex.PW7/A the prosecutrixwas born on 2nd September, 1974. Therefore, on 25th November, 1989, she was less than 16 yearsold.14. As per the report of the CW1 Dr. U.C. Garg Ex.CW1/A, the age of the prosecutrix was between16-17 years. Relying upon his opinion it was contended by the learned counsel for the appellants thatthe prosecutrix was more than 16 years of age on the date she is alleged to have been kidnapped andthat since there could be variation of up to 2 years in the age determined by Ossification Test, sheJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/5could be more than 18 years old on the relevant date.15. In my view it is not appropriate for the court to give preference to the medical opinion in theform of Ossification Test over unimpeachable and authentic documents are available in the form ofBirth Certificate of the NDMC produced by the prosecution which also finds corroboration from therecord of the hospital Ex.PW15/B and Birth Register of NDMC Ex.PW9/A. In the case of MadanGopal Kakkad vs. Naval Dubey & Anr. (1992) 3 SCC 204 the Hon'ble Supreme Court, inter alia,observed as under:"34. A medical witness called in as an expert to assist the Court is not a witness of factand the evidence given by the medical officer is really of an advisory character givenon the basis of symptoms found on examination. The expert witness is expected toput before the Court all materials inclusive of the data which induced him to come tothe conclusion and enlighten the Court on the technical aspect of the case byexplaining the terms of science so that the Court although, not an expert may form itsown judgment on those materials after giving due regard to the expert's opinionbecause once the expert's opinion is accepted, it is not the opinion of the medicalofficer but of the Court."16. In Vishnu vs. State of Maharashtra AIR 2006 SC 508, the Birth Certificate of MunicipalCorporation and register of the hospital where the prosecutrix was born showed that she was lessthan 16 years of age. On the other hand as per the Ossification Test her age was 18-19 years witherror of margin of six months on either side. It was contended before the Hon'ble Supreme Courtthat determination of the age of the prosecutrix having been scientifically proved by conductingOssification Test, should be accepted. Rejecting the contention, the Hon'ble Supreme Court, interalia, held as under:-24. In the case of determination of date of birth of the child, the best evidence is ofthe father and the mother. In the present case, the father and the mother - PW-1 andPW-13 categorically stated that PW-4 the prosecutrix was born on 29.11.64, which issupported by the unimpeachable documents, as referred to above in all materialparticulars. These are the statements of facts. If the statements of facts are pittedagainst the so called expert opinion of the doctor with regard to the determination ofage based on ossification test scientifically conducted, the evidence of facts of theformer will prevail over the expert opinion based on the basis of ossification test.Even as per the doctor's opinion in the ossification test for determination of age, theage varies. In the present case, therefore, the ossification test cannot form the basisfor determination of the age of the prosecutrix on the face of witness effects tenderedby PW-1 and PW-13, supported by unimpeachable documents.17. The judgment in the case of Vishnu (supra) was followed by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in ArjunSingh vs. State of H.P. AIR 2009 SC 1568. In view of the above referred authoritativepronouncements of the Hon'ble Supreme Court, no reliance can be placed upon the report ofOssification Test in the face of the unimpeachable documentary evidence produced by theJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/6prosecution.18. I am, however, in full agreement with the learned counsel for the appellant that the facts andcircumstances of the case rule out any reasonable possibility of the prosecutrix having been forciblykidnapped or raped against her consent as claimed by her. According to the prosecutrix afterreaching Pragati Maidan on 25.11.1989 she looked for her cousin at gate No.1 as he had asked her tomeet him there. On the other hand, the father of the prosecutrix alleged in the FIR that theprosecutrix had asked her cousin to meet him at Ahmed Food Stall. If the prosecutrix was to meetwith her cousin at Ahmed Food Stall, there was no occasion to her to go first to gate No.1 of PragatiMaidan. According to the prosecutrix, she was brought by the appellant to gate No.3 of the PragatiMaidan and was forced to board a Three Wheeler Scooter, with two knives having been kept on herperson by the appellants. She has further stated that the direction of the auto rikshaw was towardsITO and not towards Zoo. If that be so, the prosecutrix must have crossed Mathura Road in order toreach the side where the auto rikshaw was parked because Pragati Maidan is on that side of theMathura Road which goes towards Zoo whereas the auto rikshaw was parked on that side of theMathura Road which goes towards ITO. The Prosecutrix has admitted that there were lot of peoplein Pragati Maidan as Trade Fair was going on at that time. As a matter of fact, Pragati Maidan andits surrounding areas are extremely overcrowded during trade fair which is held every year between14 th November to 27th November. It is not possible to accept that no one noticed the prosecutrixgoing all the way from gate no. 3 of Pragati Maidan up to other side of the Mathura Road with twoknives having been put on her side. Had that been the case a number of persons would have noticedit and would have immediately called the police.19. Had the appellants put knives on the person of the prosecutrix at a crowded place like PragatiMaidan in day time, she would definitely have raised alarm because on account of presence of alarge number of persons, she would not be intimidated even if knives are put on her person,confident as she would be that on alarm being raised by her the appellants would be caught by thepersons who are present there and would be handed over to the police. This is more so when theappellants were not stranger to her, they being previously known to her.20. According to the prosecutrix she travelled in an auto rikshaw from Pragati Maidan to ISBT andboth the appellants were sitting on her side with knives on her person during the course of thejourney. Had that been the case, it could not have escaped the attention of the auto rikshaw driverand he would have caught the appellants and handed over them to the police instead of taking theprosecutrix and the appellants to the ISBT.21. According to the prosecutrix they boarded a bus for Merrut from ISBT. A large number ofpersons including the police officers always remain present at ISBT. It is difficult to accept thatknives had been put on the person of the prosecutrix when she remained at ISBT and boarded thebus from there but that was not noticed by any person present at the Bus Terminus. If a young girl isbeing escorted by two boys who have kept one knife each on both her sides, that would immediatelydraw the attention of some or the other person present at a busy place like a Bus Terminus and thepersons wilding knives would immediately be caught and handed over to the police. According tothe prosecutrix she travelled in a bus from Delhi to Merrut and other passengers were also presentJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/7in the bus. She has stated that knives were kept on her person even during the bus journey. Had thatbeen the case, the prosecutrix would definitely have raised alarm because she knew that on accountof presence of a large number of passengers in the bus, it would not be possible for the appellants toharm her and since the bus was moving they also will not be able to escape. In any case, had theappellants kept knives on the person of the prosecutrix during bus journey they could not haveescaped the attention of their fellow passengers.22. The prosecutrix has stated that in Merrut she was brought to hotel. She must have got down at aBus Terminus at Merrut and must have taken some means of transport for going from BusTerminus to the hotel. No alarm was raised by the prosecutrix either at Bus Terminus in Merrut orduring journey from Bus Terminus to the hotel. Had she been under threat, should would definitelyhave raised alarm and the appellants would have been caught by the persons present at the BusTerminus or the persons present on the road while they were travelling from Bus Terminus to thehotel.23. In the hotel also the prosecutrix did not raise any alarm. She did not complain either to thereceptionist or any waiter. Had she not been a consenting party she would have never have gonetowards the room and would have told the receptionist that she was being coerced to go into theroom.24. The prosecutrix has stated that from hotel she was taken to the house of the sister of theappellants. Again she did not raise any alarm when she came down from the room or when she wasbeing taken to the house of the sister of the appellants. She did not make any complaint to the familyof the sister of the appellants that she had been subjected to rape and had been brought underintimidation. The prosecutrix came to Delhi from Merrut. For that purpose she must have travelledin a bus or a train from Merrut to Delhi and would have got down either at ISBT or a railway stationin Delhi. Had she not been a willing and consenting party, she would have raised alarm at any ofthese places. Her failure to do so despite having repeated opportunities that she had accompaniedthe appellants on her own and that she was not under any kind of threat or intimidation when sheaccompanied the appellants to Merrut and was subjected to sexual intercourse firstly in a hotel andthen in a house in Delhi.25. As regards charge under Section 363 and 366 of IPC, in order to prove kidnapping theprosecution was required to prove that the appellants had taken or enticed the prosecutrix out of thekeeping of her lawful guardian. The object behind Section 361 of Indian Penal Code, which defineskidnapping, is to protect the minor children from being seduced for improper purposes and toprotect the rights and privileges of guardians having lawful charge or custody of their minor wards.What is necessary is either taking or enticement, of the minor. Taking would include causing to goor getting into possession whereas enticement involves an idea of inducement, by igniting hopes ordesire in the other. One does not entice other, unless the latter attempts to do a thing which he orshe would not otherwise have done. In order to bring home conviction for kidnapping, there must beproof of the accused having done something which led to the girl going out of the keeping of herguardian. The words 'takes' and 'entices' as used in Section 361 of Indian Penal Code need to be readtogether so as to take colour and content from each other.Jamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/826. If the minor leaves her parental home without any promise, offer or inducement from theaccused, it cannot be said that an offence of kidnapping is made out. Of course, if the accused lays afoundation by inducement, allurement etc. and that influences the minor or weighs with her inleaving her guardian's custody and keeping and going with the accused then it is difficult to acceptthat the minor had voluntarily come to the accused.27. In the present case, there is no evidence of either of the appellants having extended any promiseor allurement to the prosecutrix. This is not the case of the prosecution that either of the appellantshad promised to marry the prosecutrix or held out any other promise to her. The case of theprosecution is that the appellants had threatened the prosecutrix by putting knives on her personand being afraid of them she accompanied them to Merrut. That part of the deposition of theprosecutrix where she claimed that she had been threatened and two knives had been put on herperson when she was taken from Delhi to Merrut cannot be believed and is obviously false. Thetruth appears to be that since the prosecutrix was previously known to the appellants, and hadbecome friendly to one of them, she of her own abandoned the guardianship of her parents andeloped with the appellants. Though the prosecutrix has been found to be less than 16 years old, itcannot be said that she was not capable of knowing what she was doing. She was not of such an ageso as to be unable to decide what was good and what was bad for her. Had the prosecutrix beenabout 10 months older, even the offence of rape would not have been made out against theappellants in the facts and circumstances of the case. In my view the facts and circumstancesbrought on record clearly show that the prosecutrix willingly accompanied the appellants and stayedwith them till they were caught by the police. The prosecutrix knew and had the capacity to know thefull import what she was doing. It is, therefore, difficult to say that the offence of kidnapping hasbeen made out against the appellants in the facts and circumstances of this case.28. In order to succeed in a charge under section 366 of IPC, the prosecution was required to provethat the kidnapping of the prosecutrix was:(a) with intent that she may be compelled or knowing it to be likely that she will be compelled tomarry any person against her will; or(b) in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse or knowing it to be likely that shewill be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse.29. In the present case there is no evidence of either of the appellants having even made an attemptto compel the prosecutrix to marry him. The deposition of the prosecutrix to the effect that she wassubjected to intercourse under intimidation cannot be belied in the facts and circumstances of thiscase. Therefore, it cannot be said that the appellants took the prosecutrix with them so as to force orseduce her to illicit intercourse. The facts and circumstances of the case indicate that she was aconsenting person to have sexual intercourse with the appellants.30. In Shyam and Another versus State of Maharashtra , 1995 Criminal Law General 3974, theprosecutrix had put blame on the appellants and had deposed that she was threatened right fromthe beginning while being kidnapped and was kept till police recovered her. It was found by theJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/9Hon'ble Supreme Court that she was not truthful as regards the manner of the so- called taking. Theprosecutrix in that case was a grown up girl, though she had not touched 18 years of age but was stillin the age of discretion. She was found going on the bicycle of the appellant. The Hon'ble SupremeCourt noted that it was not unknown to her with whom she was going and therefore, it was expectedof her then to jump down from the bicycle or put up the struggle and in any case raise an alarm toprotect herself. As no such steps were taken by her, the Hon'ble Supreme Court felt that she was awilling party to go with the appellants of her own and, therefore, there was no taking out of theguardianship. The appellants were acquitted of the charge under Section 366 of IPC.31. In State of Karnataka vs. Sureshbabu, 1994 Crl.L.J.1216(1), it was found that the girl went withthe accused voluntarily. It was held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court that the requirement of Section366 of IPC is that taking or enticing away a minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardianship wasan essential ingredient of the offence of kidnapping. It was held that in such a case, it is difficult toheld that the accused had taken her away from the keeping of her lawful guardian and somethingmore has to be shown in a case of this nature, like inducement.32. In Mahabir vs. State 55(1994)DLT 428, the appellant and the prosecutrix were known to eachother. The appellant took the prosecutrix to a place outside Delhi where they stayed for about fifteendays and had sexual intercourse with each other. The appellant was convicted under Sections 366and 376 of I.P.C. A learned Single Judge of this Court noticed that she had gone to Railway Station,had stood there with the appellant who also went to purchase tickets and then she had travelled withhim in a compartment shared by other persons. She had then gone to a house in a tonga and yet shedid not lodge any protest and made no attempt to flee despite having ample time and opportunity.The learned Single Judge noted that on the day of reckoning, she surely had crossed mark of sixteenyears and since she was all along a willing party, the appellant was acquitted of both the chargesagainst him. Thus, despite the prosecutrix being less than eighteen years of age, the appellant wasacquitted not only of charge under Section 376 but also of the charge under Section 366 of I.P.C.33. In Piara Singh vs. State of Punjab, 1998(3) Crimes 570, the High Court found that theprosecutrix was more than sixteen years of age at the time of this incident, though, the case of theprosecution was that she was forteen years of old at that time. Since the High Court came intoconclusion that no force was used in having sexual intercourse with him, the appellant was acquittednot only of charge under Section 376 but also of charge under Section 366 and 366-A of IndianPenal Code. In this case also, the prosecutrix was not found to be more than eighteen years of age.34. In Bala Saheb vs. State of Maharashtra, 1994 Criminal Law General 3044, it was found that theprosecutrix accompanied the appellant/accused from her village and stayed with him for two tothree days. It was held that these circumstances clearly show that offence under Section 363 or 366of I.P.C. was not made out.35. In Chida Ram vs. State, 1992 Criminal Law General 4073, the prosecutrix went to the P.S. andlodged report that she had gone with the petitioner/accused, of her own accord. However, duringtrial, she deposed that she was forced by the accused/petitioner to go to the police station. She hadalso given statement before a Magistrate after lodging report with the police and in that statementJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/10she did not say that she was forced by the accused/petitioner to go to the Police Post and lodged thereport. A learned Single Judge of this Court observed that she had ample opportunity to say beforethe Magistrate, before whom she was produced at the first instance, that she was forced by theaccused to go to the Police Station and lodged report. The story set up by her during trial wasconsidered to be an afterthought and was not believed. It was found that she was a consenting partyin eloping from her house with the accused/petitioner. It was held that it could not also be called acase of kidnapping.36. However, as far as charge under section 376 of IPC is concerned, the appellants are guilty even ifthey had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix with her consent as the prosecutrix was less than 16years old at the time when she was subject to sexual intercourse.37. I see no reason to disbelieve the testimony of the prosecutrix as regards the sexual intercoursewith her. It is extremely unlikely that a young unmarried girl will falsely allege sexual intercoursewith her, since she knows that by making such an accusation, she would be sacrificing what is mostdear to her. In a tradition bound non-permissive society like ours, a young girl would be reluctanteven to admit an incident of sexual intercourse with her, conscious as she would be of beingcriticized not only by the society but also by her own family members, relatives and neighbors whomay somehow or the other hold her at least partly responsible for the incident which happened withher. Even the parents of an unmarried girl would not report such an incident to the police unlessthey are absolutely sure of its truthfulness. The parents of an unmarried girl would always be awareof the risk that comes to be associated with the marriage of an unmarried girl who is subjected tosexual intercourse and that too by two young boys professing an altogether different religion. Theyknow that if such an incident becomes public it would be difficult for them to find a suitable matchfor their daughter from a respectable family. Their natural inclination would be to avoid givingpublicity to such an incident lest their family name and family honour is brought under disrepute onaccount of an adverse publicity. Therefore, I find no good ground to reject the testimony of theprosecutrix to the effect that she was subjected to sexual intercourse by both the appellants.38. In his statement under section 313 of Cr.PC the appellant Mohd. Imran claimed that hisco-accused Jamal Ahmed used to visit his place and had introduced him to the family of theprosecutrix. On the other hand, the appellant Jamal Ahmed stated that it was Mohd. Imran who hadintroduced him to the family of the prosecutrix. Thus, both of them are contradicting each other asto who introduced whom to the prosecutrix.39. When Mohd. Imran came in the witness box as DW5, he stated that he had become friendly withthe prosecutrix and they had been meeting each other. He also claimed that the prosecutrix hadcome to his stall on 22nd November as well as 25th November and she had told him that she hadbeen turned by her mother out of her home. He further stated that he along with the prosecutrix andJamal Ahmed went to Merrut to consult Shri Mustafa Alam, Advocate. According to him it wasJamal Ahmed who took the prosecutrix to the house of the advocate and he himself went toBahadurgarh to bring the brother of the advocate but could not reach Bahadurgarh. However, theappellant Jamal Ahmed has not taken the same stand and has altogether denied havingaccompanied the prosecutrix to Merrut. According to the appellant Mohd. Imran he had no contactJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/11with the prosecutrix or Jamal Ahmed thereafter and was arrested by the police from his restaurant.On the other hand testimony of the police officials shows that both the appellants were arrestedfrom a flat in G.B. Pant Hospital and that time the prosecutrix was in their company. In fact, theappellant Mohd. Imran, in his statement under section 313 of Cr.PC denied having taken theprosecutrix to Merrut and did not claim that he, along with Jamal Ahmed, had accompanied her toMerrut, he had come back from there for going to Bahadurgarh to bring the brother of Shri MustafaAlam, advocate. Even otherwise it is difficult to accept to accept that if the appellant Mohd. Imranwas having relationship with the prosecutrix he would leave her in the company of Jamal Ahmedand come back from Merrut. His claim that he wanted to go to Bahadurgarh but could not reachthere because the bus had stopped on the way and he did not know the address of the lawyer and,therefore, he came to Delhi is totally unbelievable. If one bus had gone out of order, he would haveboarded another bus. His claim that he came back to Delhi as he did not know the address of thelawyer is ex- facie false, as he himself stated that Jamal Ahmed had taken them to the lawyer atMerrut. If he had gone up to the place of the lawyer along with Jamal Ahmed, there could be noquestion of his not knowing the address of the lawyer and not being able to reach there. Since theappellant Mohd. Imran Khan was having an affair with the prosecutrix, in normal course of humanconduct he must have remained with her throughout till they were apprehended by the police.40. In his statement under section 313 of Cr.PC, Jamal Ahmed does not say that he along withMohd. Imran Khan had accompanied the prosecutrix to Merrut and that in Merrut he along hadtaken the prosecutrix to the place of the advocate whereas Mohd. Imran Khan had gone toBahadurgarh to bring the brother of the advocate. He does not say that he had accompanied theprosecutrix to hotel and had stayed there in the night with her. He does not say that he alone hadbrought the prosecutrix from Merrut to Delhi. During cross-examination of the prosecutrix it wassuggested to her that in the hotel she and Jamal Ahmed had introduced themselves as brother andsister. Such a defence is inherently improbable and cannot be believed. Assuming that Jamal Ahmedalone had taken the prosecutrix to the hotel and stayed with her in the night, when a young boy goesto a hotel and takes a room on rent for staying overnight he would not introduce the girlaccompanying him as his sister because that would immediately create suspicion in the mind of thehotel staff because a young boy is not likely to stay with his young sister in a hotel in the night. Theappellant Jamal Ahmed having been identified by PW12 Data Ram as Manoj, it cannot be acceptedthat he had not gone to the hotel with the prosecutrix and had not stayed there in the night with her.If the names of both the appellants were not got recorded in the record of the hotel that by itselfwould not show that they had not stayed in the room with the prosecutrix. It is quite likely that thenames of them the boys were not entered in the hotel register because that would have createdsuspicion on account of two boys staying with a young girl in one room. Nothing prevented theappellants from taking the room for one couple and then both of them staying in the same roomduring night. There is yet another possibility that the hotel staff was persuaded to give room to allthe three but the names of only one male and one female were entered in the register in order toshow, on record, that a couple had stayed in the room.41. Whatever be the circumstances in which all the three came to stay in the same room, it is difficultto believe that the appellant Mohd. Imran Khan who was carrying an affair with the prosecutrixwould have allowed his co-accused Jamal Ahmed a young man to stay alone with the prosecutrix inJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/12a hotel in the night. Once it is shown that both the appellants had stayed in the same room with theprosecutrix, it is difficult to accept that only one of them had sex with her. If either of them did notwant to have sex with the prosecutrix, he would not have stayed in that room during the night. Inany case, had the prosecutrix been subjected to sexual intercourse only by the appellant Jamal, shewould not have implicated Imran, with whom she was friendly.42. It was pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants that there was delay in lodging the FIRas the prosecutrix went missing on 25th November, 1989 but her father lodged missing report onlyon 27th November, 1989. It was noted by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in Ravinder Kumar vs. State2001(VII) AD(SC) 209 that the law has not fixed any time limit for lodging FIR and delayed FIR isnot illegal. If there is a delay the court has to look for the reasons which could be many, but the FIRis not vitiated on account of delay alone. As regards reporting of cases of elopement of a girl that toowith boys of a different religion one cannot be oblivious to the fact that since in such cases honour ofthe family is involved, a lot of thought must have gone into, before it was decided to lodge FIR. Theprosecutrix being a young girl aged about 15 years at the time she accompanied the appellants, it isunderstandable that her father must have taken time to decide what course of action he shouldadopt. Therefore, lodging of FIR in the facts and circumstances of this case cannot be said to be fatalto the prosecution.43. For the reasons given in the preceding paragraphs, both the appellants are acquitted of thecharge under section 366/34 of IPC. Their conviction under section 376 of IPC is, however,maintained. As regards sentence though the minimum prescribed punishment is imprisonment for 7years coupled with fine, the court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in thejudgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than 7 years. The incident in thiscase took place in the year 1989. More than 20 years have passed since then. These appeals arepending for last more than 10 years. The evidence that has come on record shows that theprosecutrix had willingly accompanied the appellants to Merrut and had willing stayed with them inthe hotel where she was subjected to rape. She was more than 15 years old when she eloped with theappellants. The appellants were young boys when this incident took place. The main circumstancewhich persuades me to take a lenient view in the matter of sentence and awarding less than theminimum prescribed sentence is the consent on the part of the prosecutrix to accompany themwhich is more than evident from the facts and circumstances of the case.44. Keeping in view the facts and circumstances as discussed in the preceding paragraphs, theappellants are sentenced to undergo RI for 5 years each and to pay fine of Rs.10,000/- each or toundergo SI for 3 months in default under section 376 of IPC.45. The appellants are directed to surrender forthwith before the trial court to undergo theremaining portion of the sentence imposed upon them.(V.K.JAIN) JUDGE DECEMBER 8, 2009 RSJamal Ahmed vs The State on 8 December, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/16189839/13
