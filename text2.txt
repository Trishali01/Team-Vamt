Claimant has alleged that although management filed a false complaint case against him with afalse and fabricated story alleging ID No.138/2008 misappropriation of the property of themanagement, yet management did not issue any chargesheet and also did not hold any domesticenquiry against him. It is also alleged that the criminal case continued for about 10 years and he wasacquitted by Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate Mrs. Seema Maini vide her judgment dated 8.4.2002 inwhich the Ld. Metropolitan Magistrate noted as under :"On the other hand the defence witness produced by the accused establish that theaccused was being harassed by the management regarding which they had madeseparate complaint to the authorities and higher officials of the police and therefore,the version of the accused seems quite plausible that in order to force him to takevoluntary retirement, he was falsely implicated in this case. I find no substance in theAn Industrial Dispute Between The ... vs Unknown on 17 September, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48574786/2prosecution case, which fails."4. He has alleged that after his acquittal, he repeatedly requested the management to allow him tojoin duty but the management did not ID No.138/2008 provide him duty; that he also sent legaldemand notice dated 19.8.2002 to which management sent reply dated 30.9.2002 and rejected hisdemand. Claimant has claimed that after his acquittal of the criminal charges he is entitled toreinstatement with full back wages and continuity of service. He has also alleged that managementis manufacturing electrical switches and employs more than 100 workmen and in fact there aremore than 1000 workmen on rolls and so Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946 isapplicable to the management as it does not have certified standing orders and so model standingorders under this Act are applicable to the management but the management did not follow theprovisions of model standing orders while removing him from service. He has alleged that since thetime he was illegally thrown out of job by the management on 21.11.1992 he has not been gainfullyemployed. He accordingly prayed for reinstatement with continuity of service and full back wages.5. Despite service of the notice none appeared for the management.ID No.138/2008 The Ld. Predecessor passed ex.parte award in favour of the workman on 3.5.2005.Thereafter management moved an application for setting aside the ex.parte award.

AR for the management filed his authority on behalf of the management and stated that the nameof the management stood changed to M/s ORG Enterprises Limited having its registered office at1/7, Ram Kishore Road, Civil Lines, Delhi - 110 054.7. Management has alleged by way of preliminary objection in written statement that workmanfull and final settlement of all his dues including payment of unavailed leaves, gratuity, salary andclaim/demand of any nature including reinstatement and so on this ground reference is liable to berejected. It is also stated that the claim is highly belated since after voluntarily resigning on4.2.1993, workman approached for conciliation proceedings in 2003 alleging that he was forced toresign from the service and so not only the claim is highly belated but also is an abuse of process oflaw. It is also alleged that claimant was working as store officer in managerial and supervisoryworkman U/s 2 (s) I.D. Act. On merits management admitted that claimant remained in itsemployment from 20.9.1983 till the date of his resignation and alleged that his last drawn salary waswas working as store officer and denied all other contents of para 1 of his claim. Managementreiterated that claimant submitted his resignation on his own accord on 4.2.1993 and all his dueswere ID No.138/2008 settled finally.

It is denied that the claimantManagement admitted that claimant lodged complaint dated 25.11.1992 and submitted that thiscomplaint was withdrawn by the claimant unconditionally through his request letter on 16.1.1993which was duly received in the office of SHO Kalyanpuri on 25.1.1993. Management admitted that itlodged FIR no.493/92 and denied the rest of the averments of para 6 of the claim. Managementdenied the contents of para 7 of the claim and alleged that claimant never approached themanagement after submitting his resignation. It is alleged that claimant sent a letter datedmanagement filed a ID No.138/2008 complaint against the claimant for misappropriating theenquiry did not arise as claimant tendered his resignation. Management denied the contents of para9 to 14 of the claim and alleged that claimant is gainfully employed. It is stated that claimant is notentitled for any relief. Management accordingly prayed for dismissal of the claim.8. In rejoinder to the written statement claimant controverted the averments as contained in thethat the letter dated 4.2.1993 was forcibly obtained with false assurance of withdrawing the criminalcase vide FIR no. 493/92 and due to fear of exploitation of the workman and his family. It is alsoalleged that on 4.2.1993 itself management forcibly took a letter from him in the name of LabourCommissioner for withdrawing a complaint and in fact he never went to the office of LabourCommissioner. It is alleged that letter dated ID No.138/2008 27.3.1993 was forcibly obtained by themanagement without paying him any money. It is stated that in no circumstance he could write thathe had no bank account whereas a bank cheque was forcibly drawn. It is alleged that all thesedocuments were forcibly obtained by the management after registration of FIR against him andmanagement falsely assured that the case before the Metropolitan Magistrate shall not be pursued.It is alleged that SI Ramesh Narang of PS Samaipur Badli was a dangerous person and he torturedhim in an inhuman manner by sinking him in chilled Yamuna river at midnight and also assaultedhim mercilessly during police custody due to which he got afraid and fearing harassment by police,court and punishment, he gave letters to the management and so the contents of letters dated4.2.1993, 27.3.1993 and 29.1.1993 are denied in toto. He alleged that SI Ramesh Narang was later onarrested in the case filed by Sh. Jaswant due to illegal torture in the police custody by SI RameshNarang as per newspaper cutting Annexure A. Workman has stated that management did not payhim any amount as alleged. It is stated that management should have ID No.138/2008 paid theamount to him through cheque.9.

He deposedthat he had given application dated 16.1.1993 to SHO Kalyanpuri and the copy of the same isEx.WW1/M2. He also deposed that this letter was written by him under the pressure of themanagement. He admitted the suggestion that the document Ex.WW1/M3 is in his handwriting andbears his signatures. He voluntarily deposed that he wrote this letter at the instructions of somebodywhom he did not remember. He admitted that Ex.WW1/M4 is in his writing and bears hissignatures and he voluntarily deposed that he wrote this letter under the pressure of themanagement ID No.138/2008 and all the management persons were sitting there and pressurisedhim to write this letter for withdrawing the criminal case. He stated that he did not lodge anycomplaint against the management to the labour authority or police regarding pressurisation by themanagement as he was under the impression that management would withdraw the criminal case oftheft. AR for management did not counter this later deposition even through a suitable suggestionwhich itself shows that there is no reason to disbelieve the deposition of the claimant that themanagement had given an impression to him that it would withdraw the criminal case filed againsthim. He admitted that Sh. R.K. Dass is his neighbour and is very well known to him. He deposedthat management asked him to bring any person on 4.2.1993 and he of his own had brought Mr.R.K. Dass his neighbour and he signed Ex.WW1/M4. He deposed that Ex.WW1/M5 is in hishandwriting with his signatures at point A and B. He voluntarily deposed that this letter was gotwritten by the management under pressure that his criminal case will be withdrawn. He similarlydeposed about Ex.WW1/M6. He denied the suggestion of ID No.138/2008 the management that henever contacted the management after 20.11.1992. In my considered view he rightly denied thissuggestion because had the claimant not contacted the management then how he could have beenasked to appear on 4.2.1993 alongwith a witness is not understood. Thus it is clear that the claimantmentioned in Ex.WW1/M6 was not given to him. He denied the suggestion of the management thathe submitted his resignation on 4.2.1993. He voluntarily deposed that he gave the resignation with adeposition of the claimant was not countered even through a suitable suggestion which itself showsthat there is no reason to disbelieve the deposition of the claimant that at the time of writing hisresignation on 4.2.1993 he was under the impression that after his resignation management wouldwithdraw the criminal case filed against him. He also deposed that no money was paid to him and23. A careful perusal of the deposition of the claimant in his affidavit reproduced as above as well asmanagement could not elicit anything on record on the basis of which it can be held that thedeposition of claimant in his affidavit reproduced as above is not reliable and trustworthy. In myconsidered view from the testimony of the claimant it stands established that some officers of themanagement forcibly compelled the claimant to leave his house on 20.11.1992 and that they tookhim to the office of the management at Raj Narain Marg and threatened him and obtained hissignatures on some blank papers.

Heby him of his free will and consent and so the claimant had voluntarily given his resignation. I havecarefully considered this contention. In my ID No.138/2008 considered view, this is a misconceivedforcibly obtained from the claimant, then it is immaterial if the endorsement Mark X on the sameDass would not convert the writing of the claimant that is stated to have been obtained forcibly intoa voluntary statement.affidavit reproduced as above is not reliable and trustworthy. In my considered view testimony ofmanagement forcibly compelled the claimant to leave his house on 20.11.1992 and that they tookhim to the office of the management at Raj Narain Marg and threatened him and obtained hissignatures on some blank papers. From his testimony it also stands established that on the next daymarks on his body and that claimant remained under shock due to this incident of 20.11.1992. Fromthe testimony of Sh. R.K. Dass it also stands established that when police of PS Kalyanpuri startedmaking enquiry on the basis of the complaint lodged by the claimant Pavitra Kumar Pal thenmanagement asked claimant to withdraw the police complaint and assured him that it wouldwithdraw its complaint and that when claimant refused, FIR dated 23.12.1992 was registered U/s408 IPC at PS Samaipur Badli. This later conclusion is also supported from the fact that themanagement has filed a photocopy of the complaint dated 20.11.1992, purported to have beenreceived by ID No.138/2008 somebody on behalf of SHO PS Samaipur Badli but when thiscomplaint was received is not clear as there is no date of receipt of this complaint. Photocopy of FIRno. 493/92 filed by the management shows that this FIR was registered on 23.12.1992 on the basisof the complaint dated 20.11.1992. It appears that this complaint was purposely dated as 20.11.1992to cover up the complaint of the claimant dated 25.11.1992 to SHO Kalyanpuri.

Pavtira Kumar Palthat it would withdraw the criminal case vide FIR no. 493/92 if he gave resignation in his ownhandwriting and would also leave his terminal benefits with the declaration of full and finalpayment.examination of the claimant shows that the management did not suggest to the claimant thatwhatever he had stated in his complaint dated 25.11.1992 to SHO Kalyanpuri which was later onwithdrawn through his application dated 16.1.1993 was not a correct statement of fact and that heNo.138/2008 management to the claimant were that the documents Ex.WW1/M3 and documentEx.WW1/M4 were in his handwriting and were bearing his signatures. Document Ex.WW1/M3 is aletter dated 4.2.1993 addressed to the labour commissioner by the claimant under his signatureswhereby the claimant informed the labour commissioner that he had filed a complaint against M/sHavells' Industries, 1, Raj Narain Marg and now he was withdrawing that complaint unconditionallyas he did not have any complaint of any nature against the management. It is significant to note thatthe claimant did not write in this application Ex.WW1/M3 that the complaint made by him againstto the claimant that the complaint made by him to the labour commissioner against themanagement was a false complaint.34. Ex.WW1/M4 is the resignation letter in the handwriting of the claimant bearing his signatures aswell as the signatures of Sh. R.K. Dass a neighbour of the claimant. The claimant deposed duringmanagement. He also deposed that all the management persons were sitting there and pressurisedhim to write this letter for withdrawing the criminal case. He admitted that Mr. R. K. Dass was hisneighbour. He deposed that management asked him to bring any person on 4.2.1993 and he of hisown brought Mr. R.K. Dass his neighbour. It is significant to note that all these depositions of theclaimant were not countered by the management even through a suitable suggestion which meansdetermining the point whether the resignation tendered by the claimant was voluntarily or underpressure. Another point that assumes importance is the presence of Sh. R.K. Dass residing inneighbourhood of the claimant in Mayur VIhar Phase III. If the resignation was tendered by theclaimant in the usual course of the circumstances then obviously this resignation must have beensubmitted by him either in the office of the management at 1, Raj Narain Marg, Delhi - 54 or at theAn Industrial Dispute Between The ... vs Unknown on 17 September, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48574786/12place of his posting i.e. in Samaipur Badli which ID No.138/2008 means that his neighbour Sh. R.K.Dass was present at the time of tendering of the resignation either of these two places. R.K. Dass wasnot an employee of M/s Havells' Industries and his presence at either of these two places wasnothing but unnatural. The fact that Sh. R.K. Dass was present on 4.2.1993 at the time whenclaimant is alleged to have tendered his resignation corroborates the deposition of the claimant thatthe management had asked him to bring any person on 4.2.1993. Thus there is no reason todisbelieve the deposition of the claimant that he was asked by the management to bring any personon 4.2.1993 which means that the claimant himself did not tender the resignation but he was askedby the management and that is why the claimant presented himself before the management on4.2.1993 alongwith his neighbour Sh. R.K. Dass. As discussed in foregoing paragraphs, theimpression given to the claimant that stands established on record from the testimony of thethe criminal case against him if he tendered his resignation in his own hand and had withdrawn theID No.138/2008 complaints made to the police, labour department and the union and this is what,In my considered view, was done by the claimant Pavitra Kumar Pal on 4.2.1993 in presence of Sh.R.K. Dass. In view of the foregoing appreciation of the testimony of claimant and his witness Sh.R.K. Dass I hold that management witness Sh. Sewak Ram Arora is a highly interested witness of themanagement and his testimony does not appear to be reliable and trustworthy. Accordingly I35. In view of the foregoing discussion I hold that it does not stand established that the claimanthimself tendered his resignation of his own accord. When it does not stand established that theclaimant did not tender his resignation voluntarily then there could be no question of full and finalsettlement of the dues by the claimant. The first part of the reference stands decided against themanagement.36. Now coming to the consideration of the second part of the reference.ID No.138/2008 The second part pertains to determination of the question of termination of serviceand determination of the point whether termination was illegal and /or unjustified. As held whiledeciding the first part of the reference, it does not stand established that the claimant himselftendered the resignation. Thus the obvious conclusion is that the service of the claimant wasterminated. There is no document of the management to show that any amount was paid to theclaimant. In my considered view termination of his service was in violation of section 25 F I.D. Act.Accordingly I hold that the management illegally terminated the service of the claimant.37. This issue was framed as claimant has alleged that he was a workman whereas management hasalleged that the claimant was not a workman within the meaning of section 2(s) I D Act. It is notdisputed that the claimant was appointed as a store assistant. Case of the ID No.138/2008management is that the claimant was then promoted as store officer. It is not alleged by themanagement that the duties of the claimant as store officer were not clerical, manual, technical,operational, etc. Settled law is that designation of a person is insignificant and what is important isexamination that he was not a workman within the meaning of the term under section 2 (s) I D Act.An Industrial Dispute Between The ... vs Unknown on 17 September, 2009Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/48574786/13Further claimant had filed his claim before conciliation officer and management filed its reply to theclaim, photocopy of which has been filed by the management. A perusal of this reply of themanagement shows that management did not state in the reply filed before the conciliation officerthat claimant was not a workman under the I.D. Act. Moreover photocopy of the complaint dated20.11.1992 to SHO Samaipur Badli shows that management had written in this complaint that someworkers of the company were committing theft. Thus according to this complaint of themanagement the claimant was a worker of the management despite having his designation as storeID No.138/2008 officer. I accordingly hold that there is no reason to disbelieve the claimant that hewas a workman of the management within the meaning of the word under section 2 (s) I D Act. Thisissue stands disposed of accordingly in favour of the claimant and against the management. RELIEF38. When it is held that service of a workman was terminated illegally then the normal relief to begranted to him is of reinstatement with back wages but this relief can be moulded according to thefacts and circumstances of the case. In my considered view under the facts and circumstances of thiscase award of compensation in lieu of reinstatement and back wages would be the just andappropriate relief. Now coming to the consideration of the point as to what would be the just andappropriate amount of compensation. In the judgment reported as J.U. Akhtar Vs. Management ofM/s Markfed Agro : 2006 VIII AD (Delhi) 33, the Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held that in suchcases the ID No.138/2008 compensation cannot be less than the back wages he would otherwise beentitled to. Thus claimant is to be deemed to be in the continuous service of the management havingbeen given all consequential benefits including annual increments, bonus, leave wages and all otherlegal benefits that were being given to him by the management, till the date of this award, for allThree Lacs only) as compensation in lieu of reinstatement and back wages would be the just andadequate compensation. Accordingly I award a compensation of Rs.3,00,000 (Rs. Three Lacs only)in lieu of reinstatement and back wages. Management is directed to pay the compensation amountwithin three months of the award becoming enforceable failing which workman shall be entitled torecover the compensation amount with interest @ 9% per annum from the date of award.39. Award is passed as per the foregoing findings on the issues and reference stands answeredaccordingly. Copy of the award be sent to ID No.138/2008 learned Secretary (Labour) Governmentof National Capital Territory of Delhi for necessary action. The award be also sent to server(www.delhicourts.nic.in).
