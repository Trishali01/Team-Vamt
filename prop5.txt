More than eight years later, many of those who fled are yet to return to Mirchpur.The trigger for this crime was a seemingly trivial incident that took place on the evening of 19thJune 2010 when a dog which belonged to a Balmiki resident barked at a group of Jat youthreturning to their dwelling places through the main thoroughfare of the village.2. Of the 103 accused persons sent up for trial, five were juveniles and were tried before the JuvenileJustice Board (JJB) in Hissar.

As already noted, the charge-sheet in the present case was originally filed against 103 accused ofwhich five were juveniles. Therefore, the trials against them were separated and conducted beforethe JJB at Hissar. Initially, the criminal case against the remaining 98 accused was before the ASJ atHissar. In fact, the learned ASJ at Hissar had also framed charges against the 98 accused persons byan order dated 6th September 2010. However, pursuant to the order dated 8th December 2010passed by the Supreme Court of India in W.P.(C) 211/2010, SC No.3-SC/ST pending before theCourt of the ASJ at Hissar was transferred to the Court of the ASJ at Delhi which was notified as aSpecial Court under the POA Act and the trial was directed to commence de novo.ChargesKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/68. The learned ASJ at Delhi passed an order on charge on 10th March 2011 whereby it was held thatthere was sufficient material to frame charges against various accused persons. Subsequent thereto,12 separate charges were framed qua 97 accused persons under Sections120B/302/147/148/149/323/325/395/397/427/ 435/436/449/450/452 IPC as well as underSections 3(1)(x) and (xv) and 3(2)(iii),(iv), and (v) POA Act. One of them, i.e. Vedpal son of Dayanand (A-98), was also charged underSection 216 IPC due to the allegation against him that he had harboured/concealed Sanjay @ Handason of Dayanand (A-77) with the intention of preventing him from being apprehended.

The trial court noted that Section3(2)(v) POA Act would apply by default due to the convictions under Sections 436 and 304(II) IPC,both of which are punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10 years of more. Therefore, by thesubsequent order on sentence dated 31st October 2011, the trial Court sentenced A-20, A-34 andA-38 as under:(i) To rigorous imprisonment (RI) for life and fine of Rs.20,000/- each (which would be paid to thevictims as compensation if recovered) for the offences punishable under Section 3(2)(iv) & (v) POAAct and in default of payment of fine, to undergo further simple imprisonment (SI) for a month.(ii) To RI for two years for each of the offences punishable under Sections 147, 323/149, and427/149 IPC.(iii) All sentences were directed to run concurrently.12.

Thus, in effect, the Court is concerned with the findings of the trial Courtqua 53 of the aforementioned 57 accused persons as well as A-58.The demographic composition of Mirchpur19. The village of Mirchpur is located in District Hissar in the State of Haryana on the borderbetween the Hissar and Jind districts. Several communities such as the Lohars, Chamars, Balmikis,Brahmins, Jats, etc. reside at Mirchpur, the dominant among them being the Jat community.Yogesh Kumar (PW-7), a resident of Mirchpur, deposed at the trial that there were around 200-250Balmiki households in the village at the time of the incident. He further deposed that the membersof the Balmiki community to which he belongs earn their livelihood working as daily wage labourersin the fields of the Jat community. According to him, the numerical strength of the Jat communityequalled the collective numerical strength of all the other communities that resided in the village.20. PW-7 also deposed that the Jat community is the financially dominant community in the village.The houses of the Balmiki community were restricted to one portion of the village, i.e. a basti, issurrounded on three sides by houses of those belonging to the Jat community.Incident of 19th April 201021. The trial in the present case was essentially concerning an incident which occurred on 21st April2010 in which 18 houses belonging to the Balmiki community were burned and two personsbelonging to that community died, viz. Tara Chand and his daughter, Suman. In all, 55 personsbelonging to the Balmiki community received simple injuries while Dhoop Singh (PW-29) receivedgrievous injuries. The incident involved widespread rioting, arson, looting, stone pelting, andbrick-batting which resulted in extensive damage to properties belonging to members of the Balmikicommunity.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/1022. As noted earlier, the precursor to the incident of 21 st April 2010 was an incident that took placeon 19th April 2010. At around 8-8.30 pm on that date, some boys belonging to the Jat community -viz. A-34, A-14, and A-39 along with 10-15 other boys - were passing through the Balmiki basti in aninebriated state when a dog belonging to Karan Singh (DW-13) barked at them. The accused personstook offence to this and began throwing rocks at the dog. One of those rocks entered the house ofDW-13 who, along with his nephew Yogesh Kumar (PW-7), came out and objected to theirbehaviour. The accused persons sought to intimidate DW-13 by threatening him with violence if hecomplained further. An altercation took place between PW-7 and A-34 which was defused byDW-13. Thereafter, the boys from the Jat community left.23. Ajit, a member of the Jat community, advised DW-13 to apologize to the members of the Jatcommunity so as to avoid any further problems. Heeding his advice, DW-13 went to the house ofA-34 along with his neighbour, Veerbhan, so as to settle the matter amicably. However, both ofthem were beaten up by the boys of the Jat community who had assembled there.24. Initially, both DW-13 and Veerbhan were admitted to the District Hospital at Hansi but sinceVeerbhan had serious injuries, DW-13 took him to the District Hospital at Hissar where he wasadmitted for a day. DW-13 was called back by the Balmikis stating that there could be acompromise. Therefore, on the following day, i.e. 20th April 2010, he got Veerbhan discharged fromthe hospital.20th April 201025. On his way back to the village on 20th April 2010, DW-13 went to PS Narnaund and informedthe SHO about the incident that had taken place on the previous day, i.e. 19th April 2010. DD No.31dated 20th April 2010 was recorded in the roznamcha of PS Narnaund. An application was made bythe police on that date itself, i.e. 20th April 2010, to the Medical Officer of the Government Hospital,Narnaund for a fitness certificate to record the statement of Veerbhan. This fitness certificate wasgiven by Dr. Harish Goel (PW-55). DD No.31 clearly, therefore, showed that the police was aware ofthe incident of 19th April 2010. However, the SHO, Inspector Vinod Kajal (A-37), did not fullyappreciate the gravity of the complaint and merely sent five or six police constables to villageMirchpur to deal with the matter.26. Some PWs have spoken about the members of the Jat community moving in groups in thevillage armed with lathis and holding a community panchayat on 20th April 2010. These groups ofJats were purportedly threatening the Balmiki community. Vicky (PW-42) has stated how, on theevening of 20th April 2010, there was an atmosphere of fear in the village since a large number ofboys from the Jat community had gathered and the members of the Balmiki communityapprehended that they might be attacked. According to PW-42, on 20th April 2010, some personsfrom the Jat community panchayat went to Hissar Hospital and requested DW-13 and Veerbhan notto get an FIR registered. They offered to arrive at a compromise.27. The holding of the panchayat by the Jat members in the village on 20th April 2010 is also spokento by PWs 42, 45 and 47. It has also come in the evidence of the DWs 16 and 22 that A-34, who wasKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/11running a dairy, had not supplied milk to the Balmikis.Incident of 21st April 201028. The case of the prosecution is that at around 7 am on 21st April 2010, the Jat panchayat of thevillage came to the house of Veerbhan asking him to compromise the dispute. Veerbhan is stated tohave agreed to this suggestion. Meanwhile, at around 8 am, A-34 was passing through the main galion his baggi (cart). The prosecution version is that he threatened the Balmiki boys sitting in the galithat their houses would be burnt, as a result of which there was a verbal altercation between A-34and the Balmiki boys. A-34 then ran away from that place. At this stage, a false alarm was raised bythe Jats that A-34 had been beaten by the Balmiki boys.29. Soon therafter, Gulaba (PW-48), the chowkidar of the village who belonged to the Balmikicommunity, was returning to the village when he noticed that the wives of Satbir and Kapoora, whobelonged to the Jat community, were both carrying oil cans. He then encountered A-34, A-20, andA-25 along with 10-15 other Jat boys at the house of A-34. PW-48 states that A-34 caught hold ofhim by the collar while A-25 snatched his lathi from him and hit him on the back. When PW-48 felldown, A-20 purportedly hit him on the head. Persons from the Balmiki community then liftedPW-48 and took him back to his house where he was placed on a cot.30. When PW-48 disclosed to the members of the Balmiki community what had transpired at theresidence of A-34, Satyawan (PW-47) and other Balmiki members telephoned PS Narnaund andinformed the SHO (A-37) about what PW-48 had told them and about his witnessing thepreparations that were going on in the Jat basti for attacking the house of the Balmikis. Theyrequested the SHO to come to the spot at once. However, the SHO only sent four or five policepersonnel.31. Thereafter, at around 9 am, a large number of Jats came towards the Balmiki basti. There werepurportedly 100 to 150 Jats initially, but later this number is said to have grown to 300 to 400. TheJats were armed with lathis, jellies, gandasis, stones, oil cans, and petrol. They had brought thestones in a rehri (hand cart). They also had oil cans. The members of the Jat community are said tohave started pelting stones at the Balmikis in the basti. The Balmikis retaliated by throwing stones,brickbats, and whatever else they could lay their hands on. However, they were far outnumbered bythe Jats who were well prepared.32. At this stage, PW-47 is said to have again called the SHO from his mobile phone and informedhim that matters were getting out of hand and requested him to come to the village himself.Inspector Vinod Kajal (A-37), the SHO of PS Narnaund then arrived at village Mirchpur in a policegypsy. According to the prosecution, A-37 asked the males of the Balmiki community to assemble atthe chaupal in the Balmiki basti. Thus, the men of the Balmiki community were separated from thewomen, the children, and the elderly. While the Balmiki men and boys moved towards the Balmikichaupal, A-37 is alleged to have instigated the Jat community members to seize the opportunity andset fire to the houses of the Balmikis. The Jats, who had surrounded the Balmiki basti from all sides,started attacking them with the jellies, gandasis and lathis. They also commenced burning theKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/12houses of the Balmikis and shouted caste-based abuses and slurs such as: "chure deda ne maro";"chureya nu jala do"; "churo ke aag laga do deda ne kad do bahar"; "phook do phhok deda ne phookdo"; "jala do, aag lago do deda ne"; "churya ne dedha ne phook do, mar do"; "phook do dedhan ne,chooraya ne phoonk do"; "jala do deda ne"; "maro in dedya ne bhanjod ne kutya ne"; and "maro, jalado".33. The Balmiki men who had collected at the chaupal heard the cries of the Balmiki women. Theyran from the chaupal and found that their entire mohalla had been surrounded by the Jats. The eyewitnesses of the Balmiki community could see the mob burning the houses of Sanjay (PW-36),situated at the main road, as they climbed to the roof of some of the other houses. Tara Chand andhis daughter Suman (who was physically challenged) were badly burnt. While Suman died in thehouse, Tara Chand rushed to the house of his neighbour, Diwan Singh, with a view to saving himself.Tara Chand was then taken to the Government Hospital, Hissar in a government gypsy by his sonAmar Lal (CW-1) and his nephew Ashok (PW-35). In the incident, 51 persons belonging to theBalmiki community received injuries and 18 of their properties were burnt and there was large-scalerioting and looting of the properties.34. At the hospital, Sub-inspector (SI) Bani Singh (PW-64) initially recorded the statement of TaraChand in the presence of Dr. Dinesh Kumar (PW-68) after obtaining a certificate from PW-68declaring him fit to make a statement. Senior police officials, including the Superintendent of Police(SP) (Hissar) and Deputy Superintended of Police (DSP) (Hansi), advised PW-64 to have thestatement of Tara Chand recorded before a Judicial Magistrate.35. An application was moved before Mr. Harish Goyal (PW-55), Judicial Magistrate First Class(JMFC), Ambala, who went to Government Hospital, Hissar and recorded the second statement ofTara Chand after receiving a certificate declaring him to be fit to make a statement from Dr. DineshKumar (PW-68). After the statement was recorded, the Tara Chands condition deteriorated rapidlyand a decision was made to refer him to PGIMS, Rohtak. However, due to his extremely poorcondition, Tara Chand was shifted immediately to Soni Burns Hospital, Hissar where he wasdeclared brought dead.36. Inquest proceedings were conducted on 22nd April 2010 in respect of both Tara Chand and hisdaughter, Suman. On the same day, i.e. 22nd April 2010, DSP Abhey Singh (PW-66) arrested 18accused persons. Two more accused persons, A-12 and A-36, were arrested on 23rd April 2010. On30th April 2010, DSP Tula Ram (PW-67) took over the investigation from PW-66 and arrested A-13and A-14.Charge sheets37. On 1st May 2010, A-37 was arrested. On 14th May 2010, A-15, A-16, A-17, A- 18, A-19, A-20, andA-21 were arrested. A-22 was arrested on 15th May 2010 and on the next day, i.e. 16th May 2010,the arrests of A-23, A-24, and A-25 were effected. A-26 and A-27 were arrested on 17th May 2010.The arrests of the remaining accused persons continued to take place till 9 th September 2010. Fivecharge-sheets were filed on various dates as under:Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/13(i) On 20th May 2010, PW-67 prepared a charge-sheet in respect of 28 accused persons who were injudicial custody and filed it in the Court on 11th June 2010.(ii) On 1st July 2010, PW-67 prepared a supplementary charge-sheet in respect of 9 accused personsarrested later which was filed in the Court on 1st July 2010.(iii) On 27th July 2010, PW-67 prepared a supplementary charge-sheet against A-37 and filed it in the Court on 29th July 2010.(iv) On 16th October 2010, PW-67 prepared a charge-sheet in respect of 15 accused persons andfiled it in the Court on 18th October 2010.(v) On 28th October 2010, by the orders of the SP (Hissar), PW-67 handed over the investigation fileto Inspector Vijay Pal, SHO Narnaund who filed the charge-sheet qua the remaining 50 accusedpersons in the Court.Findings of the trial Court38. The trial Court, on 24th September 2011, delivered a judgment of 1048 pages. Thereafter, on31st October 2011, the trial court pronounced a 43 page order on sentence. As regards the incidentof 21st April 2010, the findings of the trial Court were as under:(i) Eye witnesses examined by the prosecution supported its case as regards stone pelting, riotingand arson. However, on the question of the cause for this flare up, they were either silent orinconsistent and unconvincing.(ii) PWs 30, 32, 33, and 37 deposed that A-34 was a milkman whose shop is located on the maingali. PWs 32, 37 and 42 have deposed that A-34 and A-25 were stopped by some boys of the Balmikicommunity as they were going towards A-34s shop. An altercation ensued in which A-36 sustainedinjuries as he sought to intervene.(iii) DWs 7, 13, 16 20, 21, and 22, who were all dropped as PWs and later examined as DWs, alsotestify that on the morning of 21st April 2010, A-34 and A-25 were stopped by boys of the Balmikicommunity and a verbal and physical altercation ensued.(iv) The above witnesses also testified that after A-25 raised the alarm as to what had happened, themembers of both communities gathered at the spot and stone pelting ensued.(v) Damage to the houses belonging to persons of the Balmiki community was not general butselective and scattered. Therefore, the possibility of those persons involved in the altercation withA-34 being targeted by the mob cannot be ruled out.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/14(vi) Photographic and videographic evidence did not show any jellies, gandasis or dandas lyingaround and thus called into doubt the claim that the accused had come prepared with weapons andpre-planning.(vii) The injuries on the two deceased were blunt impact and burn injuries. This, therefore, ruled outthe mob having brought gandasis and jellies with them in order to carry out a premeditated assault.(viii) Only Dhoop Singh (PW-29) had received serious injuries from danda blows but no danda wasrecovered. Further, the medical record of Gulaba (PW-48) did not corroborate his oral testimony.He only had simple abrasion injuries. Had there been repeated assault as alleged, the injuries wouldhave been severe.(ix) The call detail records (CDRs) of A-34 show that he was at Jind after 12:28 pm. DWs 32 and 33,being doctors in the Jind Hospital, corroborated the version of A-34 regarding A-36 receivingtreatment for injuries. This proved that an incident had taken place which resulted in A-36 gettinginjured.(x) As for the contention that the fact that only members and properties of the Balmiki communityhad suffered attacks and that this showed that the Jat community mob were first aggressors, noinvestigation has been made into the incident wherein A-34 and A-36 were attacked by boysbelonging to the Balmiki community. This was despite it being mentioned in the case diary andreceiving corroboration from various witnesses on behalf of the prosecution and the defence. It wasapparent that the attack on A-34 and A-25 resulted in the mob from the Jat community gatheringand pelting stones at the Balmiki community. This resulted in damage and injuries to the Balmikicommunity.(xi) Many houses belonging to the Balmiki community situated on the main gali where the incidenthad taken place were untouched. No explanation was forthcoming from the prosecution as to whythis was so when the allegation was that there was an indiscriminate attack on all members of theBalmiki community. This supported the second version given by the defence that the assault wasselective.39. The trial Court also set out the sequence of events as under:(i) On 19th April 2010, an altercation between boys belonging to the Jat and Balmiki communitiestook place. The allegation that, thereafter, boys from the Jat community were threatening membersof the Balmiki community on 20th April 2010 has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.(ii) A-34, who happened to be a milkman in the village, did not supply milk on 20th April 2010which left members of the Balmiki community aggrieved. As a result of this, when A-34 and A-25were passing through the main gali of the village on the morning of 21 st April 2010, they werestopped by persons belonging to the Balmiki community. A verbal altercation ensued regarding thenon-supply of milk which then escalated into a physical assault. A-25 managed to escape the scuffleand raise an alarm. A-36, who was nearby, went to the aid of A-34 but was brutally beaten up andKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/15was rushed to hospital. Vicky (PW-42) has testified to this altercation taking place and has not beendeclared a hostile witness on this aspect. The testimony of Amar Lal (CW-1), the son of the deceasedTara Chand, also establishes this fact.(iii) After A-34 and A-36 were taken away for treatment to the General Hospital in Jind, there wasstone pelting from both sides which escalated further, ultimately resulting in large scale damage tomany properties of the Balmiki community. A fair was scheduled at the Mata Phoolan Devi temple(managed by the Balmiki community) and thus, there were many visitors who had gathered in themain gali on 21st April 2010 which was not unusual.40. It was concluded by the trial Court that the incident on the morning of 21st April 2010, in whichA-34 and A-36 were attacked by persons from the Balmiki community, had been deliberatelysuppressed by the prosecution despite the incident finding mention in the case diary. On the variousissues which arose for deliberation in this case, the specific findings of the trial Court were as under:(i) The allegation of there being a Jat community panchayat held on 20th April 2010 is notsubstantiated by any witness belonging to any other community apart from Balmiki community. Nonames of the persons attending were provided nor have the time and place of the meeting beenmentioned. The trial Court disbelieved the testimonies of PWs 37, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 46, 47, and 49as being unreliable and held them to be improvements over their previous statements.(ii) The rioting was caused by the incident that took place on the morning of 21st April 2010 inwhich A-34 and A-25 were beaten up by the Balmiki community boys rather than due to anypremeditated conspiracy on the part of the Jat community. Therefore, the theory of the Jatcommunity conspiring to attack the Balmiki community put forth by the prosecution has not beenreliably established.(iii) As regards the charge of the Jat community members forming an unlawful assembly, it was heldthat it stood established that A-23, A-27, A-39, A-41, A-64, A-65, and A-90 were present at the spotat the time as part of the unlawful assembly and were indulging in stone pelting.(iv) It was further established that the following persons, apart from constituting an unlawfulassembly and indulging in stone pelting, were also were involved in causing damage to theproperties of the Balmiki community: A- 3, A-13, A-25, A-42, and A-94 (since deceased).(v) A-20, A-34, and A-38, apart from being guilty of the aforementioned two offences, were alsoguilty of setting fire to the house of Tara Chand due to which he and his daughter, Suman, wereburned to death. The injuries caused by the use of weapons were not substantiated since there wereno recoveries of the said weapons. However, the medical evidence corroborated the case of theprosecution that the injuries shown were as a result of stone pelting and use of brickbats.(vi) The relevant witnesses whose properties were damaged were not examined on account of beingwon over or because they did not support the case of the prosecution. Further, oral testimonies ofthe PWs and the site plan reveal that not all properties of the Balmiki community were damaged.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/16The damage was selective and lent support to the defences version that the incident was notpre-meditated and not aimed at the entire Balmiki community.(vii) It was evident from the statements of the injured eye-witnesses such as Dhoop Singh (PW-29)and Sube Singh (PW-39) that the intention of the assembly was not to commit murder. Theassembly was initially lawful which then turned unlawful as matters escalated and stone peltingensued from both sides which resulted in damage being caused to the properties of the Balmikicommunity.(viii) The post mortem reports of Tara Chand and Suman did not show injuries which proved theuse of blunt force prior to their death. The fractures were found to be burn fractures. PW-29 was theonly person who received grievous injuries inflicted by one "Ramphal son of Prithvi". However, inhis deposition, he has stated that the said Ramphal son of Prithvi was not the same as A-20 and itwas, in fact, a different person who had not been sent up for trial who had inflicted the injuries tohim. Therefore, none of the accused persons could be held guilty for the offence punishable underSection 326 IPC.(ix) The allegations made by the various PWs with regard to unlawful assembly with the commonobject of committing looting, robbery, and dacoity in the houses of Balmiki community were madeorally and were of general nature.PWs 49 and 50 were held to be unreliable. It was also viewed as unlikely that Tara Chand, who was alandless labourer, would have Rs.4 lakhs in his house. It was also found that the trunk of thedeceased Suman, when opened, showed untouched clothes and articles.(x) The prosecution had also failed to prove that the members of the unlawful assembly hadcommitted criminal trespass with the use of deadly weapons. It stood established that the commonobject of the unlawful assembly was only to cause simple injuries and consequential damage to theproperties of the Balmiki community but some persons went beyond this common object andcommitted crimes of a graver nature than those of the general mob which ultimately resulted in thedeath of the two deceased.(xi) As regards the unlawful assembly having the common object of murdering Tara Chand andSuman by intentionally causing their death by setting them ablaze, it was held that there beingmerely a fight between members of both communities, Exception IV to Section 300 IPC would notbe attracted. No grave and sudden provocation could be said to exist as there was sufficient coolingtime.41. The trial Court has also found, however, that the intention and mens rea for the offence underSection 300 IPC has not been established. Its specific findings on this aspect of the case are asunder:(i) PWs 49 and 50 and CW-1 (family members of the deceased) have testified that the deceased werebeaten, had oil sprinkled on them and were then pushed into the burning house. However, no otherKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/17PWs corroborate this evidence. Instead, other PWs have only testified that the house of Tara Chandwas set ablaze in which he and Suman died. The dying declaration of Tara Chand also did notsupport their testimony.(ii) The FSL report also does not support the prosecution version. No hydrocarbons of petroleumwere found in the ashes lifted from the spot or on the clothes worn by Suman.(iii) The post-mortem reports of both deceased persons dont show any blunt force injuries. Thisbrings into question the testimony that they were beaten with dandas.(iv) Locking of doors of the rooms where Tara Chand and Suman were present from the outside isnot established. Had the doors been locked, Tara Chand would not have been able to run to thehouse of his neighbour. The retrieval of Sumans body was done by breaking through the roof of herroom. It is possible that the door was locked from inside by Suman due to fear of the ongoing riot.(v) Despite allegations that persons from the Jat community had attacked with jellies and gandasis,none of the victims from the Balmiki community have been shown to have any incised/stab wounds.Furthermore, there are no recoveries made of such weapons.(vi) Sube Singh (PW-39) has also testified that the assailants from the Jat community left him aloneon his pleading. Pictures show him in front of his house which appears to be undamaged. Only hismotorcycle was burned when stacks of domestic fuel kept near it were burned and the flamesengulfed the motorcycle as well.(vii) The stone pelting appears to have occurred in the heat of passion as a rumour had spread aboutA-34 being killed by the boys of the Balmiki community. This resulted in the mob from the Jatcommunity burning stacks of cowdung cakes and dried sticks which were kept at various places inthe Balmiki basti.(viii) Neither motive nor intention on the part of the mob to murder the two deceased has beenestablished. If the mob had an intention to commit murder, the members of the Jat communitywould have come armed with dangerous weapons. However, no such weapons have been found.Rather, it appears that the deceased were killed as they happened to be inside the house when it wasset on fire.(ix) It had not been shown that the accused persons knew of the presence of the two deceased in thehouse as it was being burned. The theory of the two deceased being beaten, sprinkled withpetroleum and then pushed and locked into the burning house is not believable for want of reliabletestimony to that effect and the absence of hydrocarbons of petroleum on the clothes of the deceasedSuman. Furthermore, the post mortem report records that no blunt force injuries were found on thebodies of either deceased and the burns which caused their death were not oil burns but ordinary innature. There is no other forthcoming evidence to show that the accused persons were aware of thepresence of the deceased in the house.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/18(x) The act of setting a dwelling house on fire was held to be one regarding which any reasonableperson may be deemed to possess the requisite knowledge that it is likely to cause death of theperson residing there. Therefore, the case was held to fall within the purview of Section 304, Part IIIPC and not of the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.42. With regard to the alleged offences punishable under Section 3 POA Act, it was held by the trialCourt that Section 3(1)(xv) POA Act would not apply where members of the SC/ST communitydecided to leave their homes of their own volition. The threat that compelled them to do so has to bereal and actual and not imaginary or illusory. It was further held that the allegations made by Sushil(PW-25) and Vicky (PW-42) about the warnings issued by the Jat community on the publicannouncement system to the effect that they would get their boys released and that only thereafterthe victims moved out of the village have not been substantiated beyond reasonable doubt. Itappears unlikely that this could have happened as the local administration had made securityarrangements in the village and a police post was erected specially in the village and a CRPFcompany had been deployed. However, the trial Court held that A-3, A-13, A-25, A-42, and A-94 hadcaused mischief by fire with the knowledge that their acts were likely to cause damage to theproperties of Dhoop Singh (PW-29), Sanjay (PW-44), Gulaba (PW-48), Manoj (PW-45), Sube Singh(PW-39), Sushil (PW-25), Satyawan (PW-47), and Vijender (PW-40) and were, therefore, liable for the offence punishable under Section 435IPC and Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act.43. The trial Court held that A-20, A-34, and A-38 had committed mischief by fire with theknowledge that such acts would cause the destruction of the dwelling house of the deceased TaraChand and his wife, Kamala (PW-50), both of whom belonged to the Balmiki community, and weretherefore liable for the offences punishable under Section 436 IPC and Section 3(2)(iv) POA Act. Inlight of the fact that the prescribed punishment for the offence punishable under Section 436 IPC isimprisonment which may extend to a period of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act wouldapply by default.44. In its judgment, the trial Court also noted its dissatisfaction with the manner in which theinvestigation of the present case had been carried out. It noted the following failures of theinvestigating agency and the prosecution:(i) Suppression by the investigating agency of the incident on the morning of 21st April 2010 inwhich A-34 and A-25 were accosted by members of the Balmiki community resulting in analtercation in which A-34 and A-36 received injuries. This incident caused the spread of a rumourthat A-34 had been killed by members of the Balmiki community.(ii) Separation of the chargesheets with respect to the two incidents that occurred on 19th April 2010and 21st April 2010 respectively. This weakened the prosecutions own argument that the formerincident was the cause for the latter.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/19(iii) The complainant in the present case, Karan Singh (DW-13), had turned hostile against theprosecution case and appeared as a DW. Furthermore, Veerbhan, who was injured in the 19 th April2010 incident, also turned hostile in the trial proceedings before the Hissar Court and has not beenexamined in the subsequent trial at the Rohini Court. Yogesh (PW-7) has also turned hostile and didnot identify any of the accused persons in Court.(iv) Of the 95 PWs cited by the prosecution, only 43 were examined. Out of these 43, only 22supported the case of the prosecution while the remaining PWs turned hostile either on the aspect ofidentification of the accused persons or on the aspect of the entire incident itself. On the other hand,persons who had earlier been cited as PWs appeared as DWs (such as DWs 7, 13, 16, 20, and 22) andeven supported the defence version of the incident whereby it was the boys of the Balmikicommunity who instigated the incident.(v) PWs 42, 49, 50, 30, 45, 40, 36, and 33 have made huge exaggerations and improvements andhave made wholesale dock identifications which did not inspire the confidence of the trial Court.Further, even where PWs have supported the case of the prosecution, their presence at the spot atthe time of the incident has not been established and none of them appear to have injury markswhich would suggest they were present during the rioting. On the contrary, PW-47, whose presenceis undisputed, was unable to identify any of the accused.(vi) The possibility of the exhibits lifted from the scene of crime being tampered with cannot beruled out considering that Register No.19 from the malkhana which was produced in Court had beentampered with.(vii) Despite the police contingent from PS Narnaund reaching the spot at 12:30 pm, none of theassailants were shown to have been apprehended at the spot. Moreover, despite allegations of theuse of dangerous weapons, none have been recovered from the spot. The statements recorded underSection 161 Cr PC do not reveal much about the incident and have been recorded in mechanicalmanner. Even more damningly, none of the arrests have been made on the pointing out by thevictims who purportedly named the accused persons in their statements to the police. No TIP wasconducted.(viii) The prosecution failed to preclude the possibility of witnesses being won over and theirevidence being tampered with by recording their statements under Section 164 Cr PC.(ix) It appears that no expert/crime team was called to the spot which resulted inunskilled/untrained personnel being responsible for lifting forensic samples. No explanation isforthcoming from the prosecution as to how the fire spread in the absence of petrol, kerosene, ordiesel.45. The trial Court, however, did not accept the contention of the defence that the faultyinvestigation should result in the benefit of doubt being granted to the accused persons. It foundthat several PWs had supported the prosecution on material aspects of its case and that theirevidence in that regard had received corroboration from the medical evidence on the record.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/20Summary of trial Court's findings46. The conclusive findings of the trial Court regarding the guilt of the accused can be summarisedthus:(i) The presence of 81 of the accused persons was found not to have been established at the time ofthe incident. The allegations against these accused persons were found to be unsubstantiated andunproven. They were, therefore, acquitted of all charges.(ii) It was concluded that the allegations made against A-37, SHO of PS Narnaund at the time of theincident, only emerged after the intervention of political and community leaders. The chargesagainst him were framed on the basis of statements under Section 161 Cr PC which were later deniedby the witnesses who purportedly named them. It was found that no reliable evidence regarding hisinvolvement emerged from the record and therefore, the allegations against him wereunsubstantiated. He was, therefore, acquitted of all offences with which he was charged.(iii) The presence of A-23, A-27, A-39, A-41, A-64, A-65, and A-90 at the spot at the time of theincident were found to be established. It also stood established that they were part of the unlawfulassembly and were indulging in stone pelting. Thus, they were held to be guilty of the offencespunishable under Sections 147, 323/149, and 427/149 IPC.(iv) The presence of A-3, A-13, A-25, A-42, and A-94 at the spot at the time of the incident werefound to be established. It also stood established that they were part of the unlawful assembly andwere indulging in stone pelting and causing damage to the properties of the Balmiki community.Thus, they were held to be guilty of the offences punishable under Sections 147, 323/149, 427/149,and 435/149 IPC and Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act.(v) The presence of A-20, A-34, and A-38 at the spot at the time of the incident were held to beestablished. It also stood established that were part of the unlawful assembly and were indulging instone pelting, causing damage to the properties of the Balmiki community, and setting fire to thehouse dwelling of Tara Chand which resulted in the death of Tara Chand and his daughter, Suman.Thus, they were held to be guilty of the offences punishable under Sections 147, 323/149, 427/149,436/149, and 304(II)/149 IPC and Section 3 (2) (iv) POA Act.Submissions on behalf of the State47. Ms. Richa Kapoor, learned Special Public Prosecutor (SPP) appearing for the State of Haryana,submitted as under:(i) The trial Court erred in not appreciating that the incident which occurred on 19th April 2010 wasa prequel to the main incident that occurred on 21st April 2010, the preparation for which was doneon 20 th April 2010. The prosecution had clearly established the prior meeting of minds andcommon object and motive for the offences committed on 21st April 2010. It was submitted that thefinding of the trial Court that the incidences of 19th and 20th April 2010 were not proved was totallyKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/21erroneous especially since the trial Court itself, while examining the effects of complainant KaranSingh (DW-13) and Veer Bhan turning hostile, held that the FIR was not substantive evidence andthe incident of 21st April 2010 had been proved through the deposition of the injured eye witnessesand other PWs.(ii) The depositions of PWs 13, 25, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36-40, 42-47, 49, and 50 as well as CW-1 showedthat the incident of 21st April 2010 had been proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.(iii) Both dying declarations made by the deceased Tara Chand were consistent, clear, unambiguousand inspired confidence. The depositions of PWs 55, 64, 66, and 68 as well as to that of CW-1 werecorroborative of this. The trial Court erred in doubting the probative value of the dying declarations.Reference was made to the decision of Supreme Court in Dhan Singh v. State of Haryana (2010) 12SCC 277.(iv) Detailed submissions were made qua each of the PWs and the pleas of the accused persons indefence. On the charge of criminal conspiracy, it was submitted that unlawful agreement was thegravamen of the crime of conspiracy and not its accomplishment. It was submitted that the evidenceof conspiracy need not be formal or expressly made out. It could be inferred from the circumstances,especially the declarations, acts, and conduct of the conspirators. It was further submitted that theoffence of criminal conspiracy is a continuing one and is committed whenever one of theconspirators does an act or series of acts. Reference was made to the decisions in Kehar Singh v.State (Delhi Admn.) (1988) 3 SCC 609; Ajay Agarwal v. Union of India (1993) 3 SCC 609; Abuthagirv. State (2009) 17 SCC 208; K.R. Purushothaman v. State of Kerala (2005) 12 SCC 631; and SureshChandra Bahri v. State of Bihar AIR 1994 SC 2420.(v) The unlawful assembly that gathered on the morning of 21 st April 2010 was armed with lathis,jellies, oil cans and gandasas all of which are common agricultural tools found in any village. Theyhad also come prepared to pelt stones at the Balmiki community. According to Ms. Kapoor, it hadbeen established by the prosecution that:(a) The site of violence was the Balmiki basti where all the accused persons came together armedand prepared to commit the offence;(b) All the persons who received injuries or killed or whose houses were burnt and damagedbelonged to the Balmiki community apart from the large scale rioting and looting of propertiesbelonging to the Balmiki community;(c) The offence continued for over 3 hours where only persons belonging to the Balmiki ccommunitywere targeted by the accused persons all of whom belong to the Jat community;(d) The manner in which the Balmiki basti was surrounded from all sides by the persons belongingto the Jat community who were armed proves that the incident did not occur due to a sudden fightbut was premeditated and pre-planned and also reflects the common intention of the unlawfulassembly to burn down the entire basti;Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/22(e) Caste-based exhortations were made while indulging in arson, looting, rioting, injuring/killingpersons and damaging their properties by all the accused persons belonging to the Jat communitywhich was dominant in village Mirchpur;(f) The livelihoods of the victims belonging to the Balmiki community were dependent upon the Jatcommunity who could not tolerate the insult made by the dog belonging to the lower caste and thusdecided to take revenge;(g) No cross-complaint was filed by the accused persons belonging to the dominant caste and therewere no injuries reported as a result of stone pelting contrary to the claim made by the defence thatthere was stone pelting from Balmikis as well;(h) Burning of the houses of the Balmiki community was selective and occurred in pockets. Thedamage is not confined to any particular direction but has occurred on various locations in the basticlearly indicating that the common object of all the accused persons who belonged to the Jatcommunity was to target the Balmikis and their property;(j) Damage caused by the accused persons who were indulging in rioting, arson, looting and burningof Balmiki persons and their properties by surrounding them from three directions is writ large onthis case;(k) Intention of the accused persons, i.e. to burn the entire Balmiki basti by surrounding it from allsides and attacking the Balmikis by burning them alive, is clear. The manner in which the offencehas been committed and has been deposed to by the witnesses establishes that the accused personswere uniformly prepared to commit the offence in furtherance of the aforementioned commonintention.(vi) The trial Court had erred in not appreciating that Section 149 IPC provided for vicariousliability. The applicability of Section 149 IPC had its foundation in constructive liability which wasthe sine qua non for its operation. The emphasis in this provision should be on the common objectwith the object referred to meaning the purpose or design of the unlawful assembly which is sharedby all its members. Once membership to an unlawful assembly was established qua an individual, itwould not be incumbent upon the prosecution to establish any particular overt act committed bythat individual. In other words, it is not necessary that each member of the unlawful assemblycommits an overt act to attract the sanction under Section 149 IPC. The unlawful agreement and notits accomplishment is the gist and essence of the crime of conspiracy. Reference was made to thedecisions in Mahmood v. State of U.P. (2007) 14 SCC 16; Rabindra Mahto v. State of Jharkhand(2006) 10 SCC 432; Rajendra Shantaram Todankar v. State of Maharashtra (2003) 2 SCC 257;Munivel v. State of Tamil Nadu (2006) 9 SCC 394; Md. Ankoos v. Public Prosecutor, High Court ofA.P. (2010) 1 SCC 94; State of UP v. Dan Singh (1997) 3 SCC 747; Masalti v. State of U.P. AIR 1965SC 202; and Adalat Pandit v. State of Bihar (2010) 6 SCC 469.(vii) As regards the FSL report giving a negative finding on the presence of hydrocarbons in the 19samples sent to it, it is submitted that the exhibits sent to the FSL were ashes of fire debris mixedKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/23with soil, jute bag, coal piece, motorcycle, stone pieces, rusted iron nail, rope etc. which were notrepresentative of the samples of the houses which were burnt by sprinkling petrol, kerosene, diesel.It is submitted that it was quite possible that the samples which were collected from the fire debriswere not the remnants of that fires where specifically the petrol, kerosene, diesel etc. was sprinkledto put the entire house on fire. The exhibit containing ash taken from motorcycle also showed nopresence of hydrocarbons. Further, in the case of any conflict between ocular evidence of eyewitnesses and medical/forensic evidence, the Court would have to go by the evidence which inspiresmore confidence. In such cases, the medical/forensic evidence was not to be given primacy.Reference is made to the decisions in State of M.P. v. Dharkole (2004) 13 SCC 308; Ram Swaroop v.State of Rajasthan (2008) 13 SCC 515; and Mallappa Siddappa Alakanur v. State of Karnataka(2009) 14 SCC 748.(viii) It is submitted that when the eye witness testimony available on the record was credible andtrustworthy, a medical opinion pointing to alternative possibilities should not be accepted asconclusive. Such evidence must be tested for its consistency, both internally and with theundisputed facts.(ix) It is pointed out that the trial Court has given confusing findings. At one place it was held that"it is unbelievable that the fire which was selective was caused without the use of any fuel". It ispointed out that many of the houses burnt had a pucca construction. The eye witness testimony wasconsistent on the fact that the accused persons were carrying cans full of kerosene oil, petrol anddiesel; they sprinkled the said inflammable material on the houses of Balmikis and set them on fire.It was preposterous to suggest to the PWs in the cross-examination that the Balmikis had burnedtheir own houses in order to claim compensation.(x) It is submitted that the falsehood of defence added credibility to the ocular evidence whichfavoured the prosecutions case. The photographic and videographic evidence also proved that firewas set to the houses of Balmiki in different pockets. This was not only selective but the rioters wentinside the houses after crossing the courtyards to burn them and houses along with other moveableproperties.(xi) It is submitted that the mere fact that the accused persons were not specifically named by PWsin their respective statements under Section 161 Cr PC would not per se render such witness not tobe creditworthy and reliable. In this context, reference was made to the decisions in Md. AlamgirSani v. State of Assam (2002) 10 SCC 277 and Kazem Sk. @ Kamruzzaman @ Kazeman v. State ofW.B. 2008 Cri LJ 4474 (DB-Cal) wherein it was held that an omission to mention a fact in thestatement under Section 161 Cr PC cannot be said to be a contradiction. Reference was also made tothe decisions in Baladin v. State of UP AIR 1956 SC 181 and Naresh Das v. State of Tripura 2007 CriLJ 2269 (DB- Gau).(xii) Referring to the decision in Premachand S. Bansode v. State of Maharashtra 2007 Cri LJ 142(SJ-Bom), it is submitted that in the matter of appreciation of evidence, there could not be any hardand fast rule. It is submitted that the trial Court ought not to have discarded that part of thetestimonies of the above PWs which was not found incorporated in their statements to the policeKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/24under Section 161 Cr PC. Therefore, it is argued, that the characterisation of PWs 28, 38, 39, 40, 42,43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, and 49 and CW-1 as not totally reliable for the aforementioned reason waserroneous. The finding of the trial Court that PWs 10, 13, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, and 50 are unreliable isalso similarly untenable. Further reference is made to the decisions in Ramesh v. State of U.P.(2009) 15 SCC 513 and C. Muniappan v. State of Tamil Nadu (2010) 9 SCC 567.(xiii) According to Ms. Kapoor, there was sufficient evidence against each of the 57 accused to whomnotice had been issued. Likewise, even the Respondent in the other appeal, viz. A-58, wasconsistently identified by PWs 36, 38, 42, and 50 and they too had attributed a specific role to himin their depositions before the Court.(xiv) The omission on the part of the prosecution to conduct a TIP did not make the dockidentification of the accused persons by various PWs inadmissible. The trial Court should haveconsidered all aspects of the matter in the light of the evidence on record. Reliance was placed onMulla v. State of U.P. (2010) 3 SCC 508; Matru @ Girish Chandra v. State of U.P. (1971) 2 SCC 75;Santokh Singh v. Izhar Hussain (1973) 2 SCC 406; Pramod Mandal v. State of Bihar (2004) 13 SCC150; Anil Kumar v. State U.P. (2003) 3 SCC 569; and Sidhartha Vashisth @ Manu Sharma v. State(NCT of Delhi) (2010) 6 SCC 1.(xv) Ms. Kapoor then moved on to the applicability of the POA Act, the significance of which wasreiterated in the case of State of M.P. v. Ram Krishna Balothia (1995) 3 SCC 221. Reference was alsomade to Section 8 of the POA Act as regards the presumption as to offences. The writtensubmissions filed before this Court by the learned SPP go on to state:"In the instant case, the evidence led by the prosecution, enough evidence hassurfaced which is not denied by the defence that victims in the crime were of dalitcommunity i.e. Balmiki community. The fact that members of B community were thevictims and the members of J community were aggressors cannot be denied. All theaccused persons/respondents herein being member of unlawful assembly and infurtherance of common object of the assembly forced to the member of ScheduledCaste i.e. Dalit (also known as Balmikis) viz. Gulaba, family of Tara Chand, Sanjay,Satyawan, Dilbagh, Manoj, Dhoop Singh & Ors. to burn their houses, and forcedthem to leave their houses with intent to humiliate and committed mischief by fireand also caused damage to the houses used as human dwelling belonging toSchedules Caste. The entire dalit basti was surrounded by hundreds of rioters allbelonging to dominant community i.e. jat community who committed arson, looting,stone pelting, burning the persons alive and their dwelling house alongwith theirmovable properties to ashes for hours together.That after investigation, charge sheet was submitted before the designated courtunder this Act and Honble Supreme Court thereafter in view of Section 14 of the saidAct transferred the case to the Special Court designated at Delhi under SC/ST Act bynotification in the official gazette by the Chief Justice of Delhi High Court. TheSpecial Public Prosecutor was appointed under the said Act.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/25The charges were framed under the SC/ST Act and the accused persons have notchallenged the order framing charges.In fact the defence has produced the witness DW-38, who is District Welfare Officer,Hissar and was summoned by the defence to bring the record pertaining to details ofcompensation provided to the victims/affected families of Mirchpur Village in respectof incident dated 21.04.2010. His testimony is at page no.7712. He has proved onrecord the documents Ex.DW38/A (collectively) from page 7910 to 7924 which iscompensation given to Balmikis family of Mirchpur (families of PWs under theSC/ST Act).Thus in view of the evidence which has been surfaced by the prosecution on recordand defense evidence being led that victims in the incident of 21.04.2010 werefamilies of Balmikis given compensation under the SC/ST Act, the provisions ofSC/ST Act would be clearly applicable. That all the 57 respondents/accused personsand Jasbir @ Lilu would be liable for conviction under the provisions of SC/ST act forwhich they were charged and all other offences punishable under Indian Penal Code."(xvi) It is submitted that the device used by the PP in the trial, with the permission of the Court, toenable to PWs to refresh their memory cannot be held to be a leading question. Reference was madeto Sections 142 and 154 of the Evidence Act and the decisions in Sat Paul v. Delhi Administration(1976) 1 SCC 727 and Varkey Joseph v. State of Kerala AIR 1993 SC 1892. It is submitted that:"The Ld. Trial Judge is enjoined with duty to explore every venue open to open tohim in order to discover the truth and advance the cause of justice and by virtue ofSection 165 of Cr.P.C., the Ld. Trial Judge is expressly invested with right to putquestion to the witnesses and he may ask any question he pleases, in any form at anytime from any witness or the parties about any fact. Here in this case the defensenever objected the question being put by Ld. Prosecutor with the permission of courtonly to refresh the memory of the witness. Thereafter, the witness has been crossexamined at length by the defense. The contention of question being leading is raisedfirst time at the appellate stage is liable to be rejected. There is no irregularity in theTrial and there is no miscarriage of justice."(xvii) Ms. Kapoor finally submitted that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the offencepunishable under Section 302 IPC was clearly attracted. Referring to the decision in Ram BihariYadav v. State of Bihar (1998) 4 SCC 517, it was submitted that the story of the prosecution wouldhave to be examined de hors lapses or omissions in the investigation.Submissions on behalf of the complainants48. Ms. Anubha Rastogi and Mr. Shreeji Bhavsar, learned counsel appearing for the originalcomplainants/Appellants in Crl.A.139/2012, submitted as under:Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/26(i) The defence has for the first time submitted in this Court that the POA Act would not beapplicable since the incident in question was merely a quarrel between two groups, the members ofeach of which happened to belong to two different castes as a matter of chance and that there wasnothing to show that the Balmiki community was attacked due to their belonging to that particularcaste. The precise submission in this regard of the complainants reads thus:"It is submitted in response that the FIR when registered was done so under theSC/ST Act r/w IPC provisions, the chargesheet that was filed contained the SC/STAct provisions, the case was being heard by a Special Court as per the provisions ofthe SC/ST Act, the trial was transferred on the directions of the Supreme Court fromthe Special Court in Hisar to a Special Court in Rohini, Delhi. The charges wereframed which included the SC/ST Act provisions. The order framing charges was notchallenged by the accused. All witnesses, including the prosecution witnesses whohave turned hostile completely and the defense witnesses have testified that thevictim community belonged to Balmikis and the accused persons belonged to the Jatcommunity. Balmiki is a scheduled caste as per The Constitution of India and arenotified as a scheduled caste in most parts of the country. Lastly the victims weregiven compensation as per the provisions of the SC/ST Act. This fact has beenbrought on record by the defense. It, therefore, does not augur well that the defenseraises this issue in appeal."(ii) In the present case the common object of the unlawful assembly was evident from the fact thatsome of them were armed with deadly weapons. None of them were curious onlookers or spectatorsto the incident that happened on 21st April 2010. In highlighting the relationship between Section149 IPC and Section 120B IPC, learned counsel referred to the decision in Rabindra Mahto v. Stateof Jharkhand (supra) and Dharnidhar v. State of UP (2010) 7 SCC 759. Reference is also made in thecontext of the POA Act to the decision in State of U.P. v. Dan Singh (supra) and State ofMaharashtra v. Som Nath Thapa (1996) 4 SCC 659.(iii) Referring to K.R. Purushothaman v. State of Kerala (supra), it is submitted that the agreementamong conspirators could be inferred by necessary implication. The existence of the conspiracy andits objects are usually deduced from the circumstances of the case and the conduct of the accusedpersons involved in the conspiracy.(iv) In respect of Section 149 IPC reference was made to the decisions in Pandurang ChandrakantMhatre v. State of Maharashtra (2009) 10 SCC 773; Md. Ankoos v. Public Prosecutor, High Court ofA.P. (supra); Mukteshwar Rai v. State of Bihar AIR 1992 SC 483; State of A.P. v. RayaneediSitharamaiah (2008) 16 SCC 179; Musakhan v. State of Maharashtra (1977) 1 SCC 733; andRamappa Halappa Pujar v. State of Karnataka (2007) 13 SCC 31.(v) It is submitted that the defence has for the first time raised an argument of the SC/ST Act notbeing applicable but, it is pointed out, that no challenge was made by the defence to the orderframing charges. It is also undisputed that the Balmiki caste is notified as a Scheduled Caste in theState of Haryana and furthermore, as has been brought on the record by the defence, the victimsKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/27were given compensation under the POA Act.(vi) Attention is brought to the orders of the trial Court dated 23 rd, 29th, and 30th March 2011 aswell as 8th April 2011. It is submitted that from these orders it is apparent that PWs were underimmense pressure from the accused. Reference has been made by the trial Court to PWs whoreached the Court premises in the company of the accused persons who subsequently turnedcompletely hostile to the prosecution case. It is also pointed out that the trial Court had recordedthat Veerbhan who was supposed to testify as a PW did not reach the trial Court and returned to hisvillage without giving evidence.(vii) It is further submitted that although the incident on 19 th April 2010 was recorded in a separateFIR and tried separately, it is an admitted position of fact which was the cause of the incident dated21st April 2010.49. The submissions on behalf of the accused persons shall be dealt with as and when their specificcases are discussed. The Court would first like to deal with the broad issues that arise in the presentcase.Causal link between incidents of 19th and 21st April 201050. In the present case, the charge of criminal conspiracy made against the accused persons is basedon the prosecutions claim that the violence perpetrated by members of the Jat community on 21stApril 2010 was an act of planned retribution carried out in response to the incident which occurredon 19th April 2010. The trial Court, however, has taken a different view in concluding that theviolence that occurred on 21st April 2010 was to be viewed as the consequence of a fight which brokeout that morning between members of both communities.51. The FIR in relation to the incident of 19th April 2010 was registered separately and the trialsubsequent thereto ended in the acquittal of five accused persons (who are also accused herein) dueto the two main injured complainants, viz. Karan Singh (DW-13) and Veerbhan, turning hostileagainst the case of the prosecution therein. The prosecutions case is that, in response to theperceived slight that had occurred on 19th April 2010, a pre-meditated attack was planned bymembers of the Jat community whereby they sought to surround the Balmiki basti from all sidesand burn the houses of the Balmikis and attack them with lathis, jellies, and gandasis. Theprosecution does not accept the position of the defence that the violence that transpired on 21stApril 2010 was due to a reaction on the spur of the moment to a fight that had broken out in themain gali between members of the Balmiki community and A-34, A-25, and A-36 on the morning of21st April 2010.52. In the opinion of this Court, when the events that transpired at village Mirchpur during 19th to21st April 2010 are viewed in their entirety, it is impossible to concur with the view of the trial Courtthat the respective incidents that took place on the above dates are unrelated. Even though thecharge sheet in the present case refers exclusively to the incident of 21st April 2010, the clear andcogent statements of multiple key PWs in the present case cannot be ignored as has been done byKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/28the trial Court. In fact, the trial Court itself has observed that an incident involving A- 34 and DW-13and Veerbhan had taken place on 19th April 2010.53. Several witnesses have spoken to what transpired on both dates and their testimonies in thatregard remain unshaken. It is clear that the incident of 19th April 2010 was because of adisagreement that arose due to a barking dog and the harsh treatment of said dog by boys of the Jatcommunity who were intoxicated having consumed alcohol. It is also beyond question that DW-13and Veerbhan were brutally beaten when they went to the house of A-34 to amicably settle thematter. Several witnesses have spoken of a tense atmosphere having gripped the village on 20thApril 2010 as the members of the Balmiki community became increasingly apprehensive ofretributive action from the the dominant Jat community.54. In this context, it should be noticed that DW-13, despite being one of the original complainants,did not appear as a PW but as a DW. He clearly stated that on 19th April 2010, when his brother JaiPrakashs dog started barking loudly and he stepped out to check the source of the commotion, hefound boys from the village, some of whom were Jats and others Balmikies, quarrelling on thataccount. He went back to sleep after separating them. Again, after some time, he heard the noise of atractor passing through the gali in front of his house and was informed that a large number of boyswere collecting outside and that they should be made to disperse. Since DW-13 was a member of theBlock Samiti, he went to the house of Veerbhan who was also a member since he wanted to ensurethat there would be no breach of peace. Both of them then went to the place where the boys werestanding. However, before DW-13 and Veerbhan could reach the boys, stones were thrown at themby the said boys. According to DW-13, it was 9 pm and was completely dark and he could notrecognise any of them. Both DW-13 and Veerbhan then retreated. According to DW-13, Veerbhansustained head injuries on account of the stone pelting. DW-13 also sustained injuries on his leftside. DW-13 along with two others took Veerbhan to the Narnaund Hospital from where he wastransferred to the General Hospital at Hissar.55. As regards the incident of 20th April 2010, DW-13 proved that Veerbhan got discharged fromthe General Hospital at Hissar. He also states that he went to the PS on that date and orallyinformed the officer about the incident which took place on 19th April 2010. Whilst DW-13 hadstood outside the PS, Veerbhan had gone inside.56. As regards the situation in the village on 20 th April 2010, PWs 37, 38, and 42 speak about the"atmosphere of fear" in the village. A-34 allegedly stopped the supply of milk in the village and Jatboys, having consumed alcohol, were moving around in groups and threatening the Balmikis.PW-37 stated that "on 20.04.2010 we came to know in the village that these boys from the Jatcommunity would again commit some problem due to which reason we called Karan Singh and VeerBhan back to the village". It was further elicited in PW-37s cross examination that "Rajender son ofPale used to supply milk in the village. It is correct that he did not supply to the Balmikis on20.04.2010". PW-38 also stated that "on the next day i.e. 20th there was a talk in the village by theboys belonging to the Jat community threatening that they would burn the houses of the churas' andwould throw them out of the village chura ne kadage, chura ne ghara ne aaglageye gai".Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/2957. Thus, in the opinion of this Court, it would be remiss to ignore the clear causal link that existsbetween the incidents that occurred on 19 th, 20th, and 21st April 2010. The trial Court has erred indisregarding this aspect of the present case. It is not beyond reason that in a village like Mirchpurwhere most people are known to each other, an incident such as the one which admittedly took placeon 19th April 2010 could have led to heightened tensions between the two communities. Theincident on 21st April 2010, therefore, has to be viewed in the context of the prevailing tension dueto the perceived slight against the Jat community by persons from the Balmiki community whichoccurred on 19th April 2010.The incident of 21st April 2010: the Trial Court's findings58. As for the incident of 21st April 2010, the trial Court seems to have accepted the alternatecontention of the counsel for the accused that the events that transpired on that date had nothing todo with the incident of 19 th April 2010 or the conditions that prevailed on 20th April 2010.According to the trial Court, as a result of a physical altercation that took place between A-34 andA-25 and some Balmiki boys on the morning of 21st April 2010 and A-34 running into the Jat bastishouting that he had been beaten by the Balmikis that the subsequent attack on the Balmiki bastitook place. According to the trial Court, there had been deliberate supression by the police in itsinvestigation of this incident on the morning of 21st April 2010.59. In the narration of facts by the trial Court, there have been 11 specific stages noticed as under:(i) Some incident of quarrel between the boys belonging to the Balmikis and the Jats took place inthe morning of 21 st April, 2010 which aggravated into large scale rioting and violence.(ii) The testimonies of Mahajan (PW-38), Vicky (PW-42), Sajjna (DW-7), Ajmere (DW-16), RamNiwas (DW-20) and Dharambir (DW-21) revealed that on 21st April 2010 there was an incidentwhich occurred when A-34 was returning to the village on a baggi and was passing through the maingali on which houses of those belonging to the Balmiki community were situated. He was stopped bysome boys belonging to the Balmiki community after which there was an altercation between A-34and a number of Balmiki boys after which he ran away from that place whilst raising an alarm"churya ne mar diya, churya ne mar diya".(iii) The evidence of Sajjna (DW-7), Ajmer (DW-16), Ram Niwas (DW-20), Dharambir (DW-21), andPraveen (DW-22) speaks about A-34 and A-25, who both belonged to the Jat community, beingstopped by the Balmiki boys after which there was a verbal and physical altercation. A-25 managedto free himself and raised a hue and cry whilst shouting "Rajender ko Balmikiyone maar diya". A-36,who also belongs to the Jat community, was a bystander who came to the aid of A-34 but was alsoattacked with a jellie (a pointed implement commonly used for agricultural purposes) as a result ofwhich he sustained injuries around his eye. After this, both A-34 and A-36 were allegedly rushed tothe hospital by Prem Singh, the father of A-36.(iv) On the alarm being raised by A-25, a large number of residents of the village gathered at thespot where the incident took place after which there were tensions in the village as the BalmikisKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/30thought they were going to be attacked and stone pelting started from both sides. The matterthereafter got aggravated and subsequently resulted in damage to the properties of personsbelonging to the Balmiki community, particularly around the area where the incident took place.(v) It is evident from the site plan and photographs and video recording/clippings that the damageto the houses of the persons belonging to the Balmiki Community "was not general but selective andscattered". Therefore, "the probability and possibility of the rioters having damaged specificproperties particularly belonging to the boys/persons involved in the assault upon Rajender in themorning cannot be ruled out".(vi) From the photographs and video clippings which were taken within a few hours of theincidenton 21st April 2010, it was evident that large scale stone pelting and brickbatting had taken place but"not even a single photograph/video clipping reflect any dangerous weapons like gandasis and jellieslying at the spot" which were required to be shown thereby "ruling out the use of these weapons orpre-planning as alleged by the prosecution".(vii) The medical evidence qua Tara Chand and Suman rules out the use of force (dandas) or thesprinkling of kerosene as alleged by the family of the deceased and shows that they were the onlyones who had suffered burn injuries and no other victim of the other 53 alleged victims received anyburn injuries. Of these 53, only Dhoop Singh (PW-29) suffered grievous injuries whereas all othersreflected either simple or no injuries which could be caused by brickbats and stone pelting but notby gandasis, jellies and other dangerous weapons thereforeagain ruling out the possibility of pre-plan as alleged by the prosecution.(viii) While Dhoop Singh (PW-29) did suffer grievous injuries, he was unclear about the identity ofA-20 who had attacked him. No danda was recovered. Further Gulabas (PW-48) MLC did notcorroborate his testimony.(ix) From the CDRs of the mobile number used by A-34, it is evident that at 1:07 pm on 26th April2010, he called Dr. Kuldeep (DW-33). The CDR also showed that the Dr. Rajesh Gandhi (DW-32)attended to A-34 on a priority basis in view of the seriousness of the injuries. This evidence provedthat "some incident had taken place in the morning at village Mirchpur in which Dinesh hadreceived injuries for which he was rushed to General Hospital, Jind and was provided treatmentthere".(x) Although the case diary noted the morning incident involving A-34 and A-25, this aspect wasaltogether suppressed and not investigated. This aspect finds corroboration in the evidence of DWs7, 16, 20, 21, and 22. It was on the complaint of DW-13 that the FIR was registered. It was naturalthat after coming to know that A-34 had been injured or killed, a crowd of Jats collected at the spotof the incident which was in the Balmiki basti. It was from this point onwards that the stone peltingstarted from both sides. It was the Balmiki community who suffered the brunt of the assault. The Jatcommunity was more aggressive and much larger in number and therefore, they were able tooverawe the Balmiki community and cause damage to their properties.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/31(xi) None of the houses of the Balmiki community situated on the main street were touched and thiscould not be explained by the prosecution. This supported the second version that the assault was"selective and not general as alleged by the prosecution".60. Based on the above analysis, the trial Court reconstructed the sequence of events as under:(i) The incident of 19th April 2010 was not proved beyond reasonable doubt.(ii) In the criminal case arising out of the FIR registered for the incident on 19th April 2010,Veerbhan himself had turned hostile and was not examined in the trial in the present case.(iii) Many PWs who had not been declared hostile have themselves supported different versionsaccording to which everything was peaceful on 20th April 2010.(iv) The Balmiki community members were aggrieved by A-34 not supplying milk to them on 20thApril 2010.(v) A-34 and A-25 were passing through the main gali as they returning home from the fields on 21stApril 2010 when both of them were stopped by boys from the Balmiki community. A verbalaltercation ensued and later, the dispute escalated into physical violence. The Balmiki boysassaulted A-34 and A-25. A-25 managed to escape and ran into the Jat basti and raised an alarm byshouting that A-34 had been assaulted.(vi) A-36 rushed to the rescue of A-34 but was brutally beaten and assaulted with jellies as a result ofwhich he sustained injuries in his eye and had to be rushed to the hospital.(vii) Vicky (PW-42) also admitted that an altercation had taken place on 21st April 2010 when A-34was attacked by the Balmiki boys and that A-36 in trying to save him also suffered injuries and thatthere a rumour had been spread that A-34 had been killed. PW-42 had not been declared hostile.(viii) The testimonies of many eye witnesses including CW-1 talks of the altercation between A-34and a number of boys of the Balmiki community. CW-1 tried to evade and brush aside the queries inthis regard.(ix) It stood established from the testimonies of various eye witnesses, including PWs who were notexamined as such but later appeared as DWs, that after A-34 and A-36 sustained injuries and weretaken away for treatment, there was stone pelting from from both communities which aggravatedinto large scale damage being caused to the properties belonging to the Balmiki communityincluding the burning down of the house of Tara Chand in which he and his daughter Suman bothlost their lives.(x) A-34 and A-36 had been taken to the General Hospital in Jind for treatment.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/32A-36 had to be hospitalised and the scars of his injuries were still visible when DW-32 was examinedin Court.(xi) There is a temple of Mata Phoolan Devi on the outskirts of the village. The management of thetemple and offering rights were with the Balmiki community for 20 years. Every Wednesday therewas a mela in the temple at which a large number of persons from Mirchpur itself and also from theneighbouring villages would come for darshan (patronage). The day of the violence, i.e. 21st April2010, was also a Wednesday and therefore, a number of visitors had gathered in the village whichexplained the presence of a large number of persons in the village, particularly at the main galiwhich was to the side of the Balmiki basti.This Court's analysis of the incidents of 21st April 201061. This Court now proceeds to deal with each of the above conclusions arrived at by the trial Court.In the first instance, it must be noted that the trial Court has erred in completely disassociating theincident of 19 th April 2010 from the incident of 21st April 2010 only because a separate FIR hadbeen registered in respect of the incident of 19th April 2010. In the criminal trial arising out of theincident of 19th April 2010, by the judgment dated 27th March 2012, the learned AdditionalSessions Judge at Hissar acquitted the seven accused in that case, viz. Sumit son of Satyawan (A-27in SC No.1238/2010), Rajender son of Pale (A-34 in SC No.1238/2010), Ajeet son of Sukhbir (A-9 inSC No.1238/2010), Deepak @ Sonu son of Kishan (A-14 in SC No.1238/2010), Pawan @ Tinku sonof Sewa Singh (A- 96 in SC No.1238/2010), Virender @ Kala son of Ram Mehar, and Monu son ofSuresh (A-39 in SC No.1238/2010). The main reason for the said acquittal was that Veerbhan, whowas an injured witness and the complainant in that incident as clearly spoken to by DW-32, turnedhostile. Veerbhan was examined as PW-1 in that case. Karan Singh (DW-13) was examined as PW-2and he too turned hostile. As a result, the case resulted in the acquittal of the accused.62. Strangely, Karan Singh (DW-13) has been examined as a DW in the present case and hisexamination-in-chief and cross-examination took place on 1st June 2011, i.e. before the judgment ofacquittal in the aforementioned case. What is apparent, therefore, is that DW-13, who was a keywitness and on whose complaint the FIR was registered with regard to the incident of 19th April2010, had been won over by the Jats even before 1 st June 2011. DW-13 was among the Balmikiswho stayed back in Mirchpur after the incident. It is significant to note that the trial Court itself hasnoted the following on page 632 of 1048 of its judgment:"In this regard, I may further observe that the witnesses who are presently residing atVed Pal Tanwar Farm House are the witnesses who have supported the prosecutioncase and to some extent identified the accused before the court whereas the witnesseswho are residing at village Mirchpur are the one who have not supported theprosecution case with regard to the incident but have also explained the cause of theincident as narrated in the FIR or brought out in the charge sheet filed by theprosecution but have supported the defence version of the incident. The witnesseshave either not identified the accused or extremely selective while identifying some ofthe accused before this Court."Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/3363. Having observed as above, it is surprising that the trial Court, while discussing these events,failed to notice that DW-13 was in fact not denying the incident of 19th April 2010. It is claimed thatwhen he and Veerbhan went to check on the commotion that was occurring in their neighbourhoodat around 9 pm on 19th April 2010, some boys threw stones at them and asked them to leave. Therecan be no doubt as to who those boys were and as to which community they belonged. Theprosecution case in the trial at Hissar collapsed due to the failure of DW-13 and Veerbhan to identifythe assailants. However, nowhere has the incident itself been denied.64. It is, therefore, plain that even according to DW-13, there was an incident wherein his brotherJai Prakashs dog barked at the Jat boys and that is what led to an altercation and some stone peltingdue to which Veerbhan suffered head injuries. DW-13 has himself spoken about Veerbhansadmission to the General Hospital at Hissar; his being discharged from there in the evening of 20thApril 2010; and how he himself went to the PS on 20th April 2010 and informed the police officerabout the incident of 19 th April 2010.65. The trial Court should have been alert whilst perusing this kind of evidence, particularly after ithad noticed that many Balmiki witnesses had been won over by the dominant Jat community evenbefore the trial began. It is clear that the Balmikis who stayed back in Mirchpur had to buy peace.There is no way that they could have gone back to their homes and continued to live in the village asif nothing had happened after deposing against the Jats in the Court. The trial Court noticed thatmany of them were accompanied by the accused when they came to the Court to depose. It is plainthat the SPP who conducted the trial felt that these members of the Balmiki community were notavailable to the prosecution and he was forced to drop them as PWs.66. The trial in the present case is a striking example of how difficult it is to conduct a fair trialwhere charges are under the POA Act. This is despite the fact that the trial was shifted from Hissarto Delhi by the Supreme Court of India. Clearly this geographical distance was not sufficient toinsulate the members of the Balmiki community from intimidation by the dominant communitywhen it came to their fearlessly deposing in a trial. The trial Court ought to have viewed it as afailure of the criminal justice system and should have proactively worked to arrive at the truthdespite these developments. Instead, the trial Court appears to have simply accepted the versions ofthe DWs and come to the conclusion that A-34 and A-36 were attacked by the Balmiki boys on themorning of 21st April 2010.67. The trial Court was, therefore, wholly in error in completely dissociating the incident of 19thApril 2010 with that which occurred on 21st April 2010. The incident of 19th April 2010 is spoken toby other PWs as well, viz. PWs 37, 38, 42, and 45. It is one thing to say that the said incident is beinginvestigated separately and the culpability for that incident had to be fixed in a separate trial. It isanother to say that this incident had nothing to do with what transpired subsequently. The latterinference was incorrectly drawn by the trial Court and therein lies one of the central flaws in thereasoning of the trial Court.68. The trial Court also appears to have erred in holding that it is only the quarrel between A-34 andA-25 on the one hand and the Balmiki boys on the other on the morning of 21st April 2010 that ledKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/34to the subsequent incident in which the houses of the Balmikis were burnt and destroyed and inwhich Tara Chand and Suman lost their lives. If the three dates are seen in sequence, i.e. 19th, 20thand then 21st April 2010, it is plain that tensions were building up from the first day itself. In fact,the trial Court notices that A-34, who was running a dairy, stopped supplying milk to the Balmikison 20th April 2010. Clearly, this was on account of the incident of 19th April 2010 wherein the dogof Jai Prakash barked at him and others and subsequently an altercation took place which led to theinjuries caused to Karan Singh (DW-13) and Veerbhan.69. This Court has already adverted to the evidence on record in the form of PWs 37, 38, and 42 whohave spoken about the tense atmosphere in the village on 20th April 2010. With A-34 stopping thesupply of milk on 20th April 2010, the Balmikis, who were dependent on him for their milk supplies,were naturally upset. Therefore, it would be incorrect to say that it is only the incident whichoccurred on the morning of 21st April 2010 that led to the subsequent events and that the incidentof 19th April 2010 and the prevailing atmosphere of fear on 20th April 2010 were completelyunrelated to the rioting that took place on 21st April 2010.70. As this Court views it, what transpired on the morning of 21st April 2010 is that there was apanchayat of Jats held at around 7 am. The Jats went to meet Veerbhan and asked him tocompromise the dispute. Veerbhan is stated to have agreed to do so. That very morning, A-34 waspassing through the main gali on a baggi (cart) as he was returning home from the fields. DWs 7, 16,and 20 (all of whom are Balmikis) have deposed to having seen a group of Balmiki boys attackingA-34 thereafter.71. The trial Court appears to have lost sight of the medical evidence when scrutinising thetestimonies of witnesses in this regard. It is significant that although A-34 claims to have also goneto the General Hospital in Jind where he was examined by Dr. Gandhi (DW-32), there is not a singledocument in the form of an MLC that reveals when A-34 had, in fact, been there.72. On the other hand, as noted by the trial Court itself, the CDR of the mobile phone used by A-34reveals that he first called Dr. Kuldeep (DW-33) at 1:07 pm on 21st April 2010 and it was DW-33who then referred him to DW-32 who examined him. This examination, therefore, could have takenplace only after 1:07 pm and not earlier. This meant that A-34 did not reach the General Hospital atJind prior to 1 pm. There is nothing in the cross-examination of DW-32 that suggests that A-34came to the General Hospital in Jind at any time earlier than 1 pm.73. Turning now to A-36, the trial Court concludes that he was "brutally assaulted by a jellie". Thiswas based on the testimonies of DWs 7, 16, and 20. In fact, DW-16 specifically states that A-36 wasinjured around his eye/temple and a "large chunk of his skin had peeled off". The medical evidence,however, is to the contrary. The MLC of A-36 (Ex.DW-32/A) shows that he was brought to theGeneral Hospital in Jind only at 1:15 pm. There is no noting in the said MLC about A-36 havingsuffered any grave injury.74. What is also significant is A-36 telling the treating doctor that he had sustained those injuriesbecause he "fell down from a baggi". It is odd that, if he was in fact attacked by the Balmiki boys, heKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/35would not even name them or tell the doctor that he had been attacked or assaulted. In such anevent, it is highly unlikely that he would tell the doctor that he had simply fallen down from a baggias it was not in his interests to protect the Balmiki boys in any case.75. The cross-examination of DW-32, who himself prepared that MLC, did not show that he hadwrongly noted anything in the said MLC. DW-32 also does not appear to have written down hisobservations about any injury on or near the eye of A-36. There is no doubt that, in hiscross-examination, he adverts to the fact that A-36 was referred to a surgeon who in turn referredhim for ophthalmological examination to PGIMS, Rohtak. The surgeon reported that no surgicalattention was required. There is no indication that the eye surgeon at PGIMS, Rohtak indicated anyserious damage to the eye. In the Court, DW-32 again examined A-36 and noticed the scar mark ofthe injuries still present on the "frontal temporal and right cheek near the eye".76. What was entirely missed by the trial Court was the time when A-36 was brought in for theexamination conducted by DW-32. As per the MLC, he was taken to the hospital at around 1.15 pmon 21st April 2010. This being the case, there was no way that A-36 had been attacked at 8 am in themorning. The large time gap between the purported attack on A-36 and when he was subsequentlyexamined by DW-32 has not been attempted to be explained by the defence.77. Consequently, the medical evidence brought on record by the defence itself did not support itstheory that:(i) A-34 was assaulted by the Balmiki boys at around 8 am on 21 st April 2010 as a result of which hehad to be immediately taken to the General Hospital in Jind.(ii) When A-36 tried to intervene to save A-34, he was brutally attacked with jellies wielded by theBalmiki boys, as a result of which he suffered an injury near the eye and he too had to be rushedimmediately to the General Hospital in Jind.(iii) It is only after A-34 and A-36 were removed to the General Hospital, Jind that the stone peltingstarted.78. The above sequence has not been proved by the evidence brought on record by the defence itself.The fact that A-34 went into the Balmiki basti and proceeded to taunt the Balmiki boys or that A-25ran into the Jat basti shouting that A-34 had been assaulted (which the trial Court at various placestranslates as A-34 having been killed with the words mar diya being capable of being interpreted asboth assaulted or killed) shows that the Jat boys wanted to create further panic and furore byexaggerating what perhaps could have ended up being only a minor scuffle. This need to exaggeratewhat was essentially a minor scuffle as an assault by the Balmiki boys on the Jat boys, viz. A-34,A-25, and A-36 is itself indicative of the simmering tension which was like gunpowder kept waitingfor a spark. This was again completely missed by the trial Court by seeing the incident on themorning of 21st April 2010 as a one-off incident having nothing to do with the events of 19th and20th April 2010.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/3679. This Court would also like to consider the incident in which Gulaba (PW-48) was attacked bymembers of the Jat community as he was returning home having collected lassi on the morning of21st April 2010. The evidence of the PWs does not aid us in determining the specific time when thisassault occurred. An overall reading of the various testimonies, however, brings us to the logicalconstruction of events as follows:(i) There was a panchayat of the Jats held at 7 am on 21st April 2010.(ii) Veerbhan is approached for a compromise soon thereafter by the Jats.(iii) Meanwhile, there is an altercation between A-34 and A-25 on the one hand and some Balmikiboys on the other regarding the non-supply of milk by A-34.(iv) A-25, with a view to creating tension and panic and also inciting violence, runs into the Jat bastiwhilst raising an alarm and exaggerating that A-34 had been attacked/killed.(v) Gulaba (PW-48) picked up some lassi and was returning home in the opposite direction andwhen he was passing by the house of A-34, he was beaten up by A-34 and some other boys from theJat community.80. The trial Court also missed another important aspect, viz. that as Gulaba (PW-48) was returninghome, he noticed that Jat women were already carrying oil cans and peepis (containers). In otherwords, preparations had already been made on the side of the Jats for a major assault on theBalmikis. After Gulaba (PW-48) was lifted by persons from his mohalla and returned home, thestone pelting started because by that time the Jats had assembled in larger numbers, as noticed bythe trial Court itself.81. Much has been emphasized by the trial Court and also by the learned counsel appearing for theaccused before us about how it was the Balmiki community that started throwing stones at the Jatsand not the other way around. The trial Court appears to have bought into the defence argumentthat there was stone pelting on both sides at the start of the violence. It is, however, not in disputethat the Jats clearly outnumbered the Balmikis. What was initially described as a gathering of 100 to150 Jats had swelled to 400 to 500. With the Balmikis being so clearly outnumbered, any stonepelting or brickbatting which took place on their part was clearly an attempt to ward off the Jats oras retaliation for the attack on them.82. The trial Court correctly notes that the photographs and videographs on record show thepresence of a large number of brickbats and that these were the brickbats brought by the Jats andthrown on the Balmikis. Clearly, the aggressors were the Jats because they came into the Balmikibasti and attacked the Balmikis. This basic fact was lost sight of by the trial Court in simplyrecording the entire incident as one in which both communities pelted stones at each other. It isplain, when the incidents of 19th, 20th, and 21st April 2010 are viewed collectively, as to who theaggressors were and who the victims.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/37Site plans & photographic and videographic evidence83. Another important piece of evidence which was completely missed by the trial Court was the siteplan of the village, drawn up and exhibited as Ex.PW-54/B. A careful perusal of the site plan, whichis not a scaled site plan, shows that it was drawn up over a period of three days by PW-54, a headconstable attached to the Haryana police, on the instructions of the IO and after visiting the housesof the victims. This site plan shows that the burning of houses of the Balmikies was certainly notdirected at the houses situated on the main gali but on the side of the fields to the south and thehouses located on the western side of the village. In other words, the plan hatched by the Jats was tohem the Balmikis in from all directions and ensure that there was no escape.84. Since they were boxed in from the south, i.e. where the main gali led to the fields, there was noway the Balmikis could have run into the fields to save themselves. Since they were hemmed in fromthe west, they could not have also run towards the temple to save themselves. Instead, with theBalmikis being surrounded by Jat bastis on all sides and with the Jats attacking them from theperiphery of the Balmiki basti, the Balmikis had no option but to run to the main gali to savethemselves. As noticed by the trial Court, the main gali itself was filled up by the Jats who hadassembled there and these Jats possibly also included people who had come for the temple festivalon a Wednesday. The net result was that the Balmikis were trapped with no way to run andtherefore had to face the brunt of the stone pelting, burning of their houses and shops and thelooting and destruction of their property.85. The evidence of PW-54 is of significance. He has explained how he not only drew up the largesite plan (unscaled) of the entire village which shows that the houses of Balmikis are surrounded onall sides by the houses of Jats and also shows those houses of the PWs that were burnt or destroyed(there were many more such houses that were burnt/destroyed). However, PW-54 also drew up 33individual site plans (scaled) which were marked as Ex.PW-54/A-1 to A-33. In other words, therewere at least 33 houses of the Balmikis visited by PW-54 and he was able to show in each of the siteplans the manner in which the property was either burnt or the articles therein looted or destroyed.86. PW-54 was hardly subjected to any cross-examination. The only suggestion to him was that hedrew up the site plans whilst sitting in the PS and without having visited the site. He obviouslydenied this preposterous suggestion. There is no way anyone could have drawn up either theunscaled site plan or the scaled site plan of individual houses without visiting those houses. In fact,there is no suggestion to him at all that anything depicted in the unscaled site plan of the village orin the scaled site plans of the damaged houses was erroneous.87. This large unscaled site plan also shows clearly the place where the attack on Veerbhan andKaran Singh (DW-13) took place on 19th April 2010 which was near the house of A-34. The site planalso shows the chaupal where the Jats had assembled on 21st April 2010. It shows the houses of keyPWs, viz. Rajesh (PW-46), Gulaba (PW-48), Dilbagh (PW-43), Satyawan (PW-47), and Sube Singh (PW-Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/3839). The house of the deceased Tara Chand is also shown on the said site plan.88. The reading of the evidence of PW-42 by the trial Court is incorrect. Later in this judgment, thisCourt proposes to discuss his evidence at some length. He certainly did not admit to the altercationearly on 21st April 2010 between A-34 and some Balmiki boys in the main gali which purportedlyhappened due to A-34 stopping the supply of milk to the Balmiki residents of the village. He also didnot admit to A-36 receiving injuries when he tried to save A-34. Also, nowhere does Amar Lal(CW-1) speak about A-34 or A-36 being attacked by the Balmiki boys physically. The trial Court hasdrawn such conclusions on the basis of an erroneous reading of their testimonies.89. Nothing turned on the fact that the Mata Phoolan Devi Temple was being managed by themembers of the Balmiki Community. How this could be interpreted as evidence against them cannotbe understood. On the other hand, it may probably explain cause for a further grudge amongst themembers of the dominant community. Be that as it may, there is nothing to indicate that theconflagration was a result of any purported attack by Balmiki boys on A-34, A-25 and A-36. It mayhave been because of the false rumours started in that regard but the fact that a false rumour couldlead to violence on such a large scale only further strengthens the argument that this violenceperpetrated against the Balmiki community was the result of deeply held prejudices on the part ofthe dominant community, i.e. the Jats.90. The disproportionate manner in which the members of the Jat community reacted not only tothe incident of 19th April 2010 but even to the supposed altercation between A-34 and the Balmikiboys on the morning of 21 st April 2010 is also demonstrative of the deep prejudices harboured bythe members of the dominant community against the Balmikis. This is a social reality which hasbeen lost sight of by the trial Court and has led to surmises and conjectures about the incident onthe morning of 21st April 2010.91. Much has been made by the trial Court about the suppression by the police of the incidents of themorning of 21st April 2010 in the charge sheet. As already noticed, there is no clear evidence thathas emerged about any physical attack on A-34 or A-36 by the Balmiki boys on the morning of 21 stApril 2010 at around 8 am. If A-36 had in fact been attacked by the Balmiki boys, there is no waythat he would not have informed the doctors treating him about such an incident and instead havetold them that he simply fell down from a baggi. Further, if A-34 had actually been attacked, thereshould have been some MLC produced to show that he suffered some injuries in such an eventwhich would require him to be taken to the General Hospital, Jind.92. It appears to this Court that the incident which purportedly took place at 8 am on 21st April2010 was entirely fictional and was in fact used to stoke the fire as is seen by A-25 running towardsthe Jat basti shouting that A-34 had been attacked/killed. It is fairly obvious that this narrative wasuseful in aggravating the prevailing tensions and ensuring an explosive and wholly disproportionatereaction from the Jat community. Consequently, this Court is unable to subscribe to the sequence ofevents that has been laid down by the trial Court or its analysis of the same in trying to shift theblame onto the Balmiki boys for attacking the the members of the Jat community on the morning of21 st April 2010 which proved to be the spark that set off the violence that ensued on that date.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/3993. This has also led the trial Court to wrongly conclude that there was no criminal conspiracyhatched by the Jat community to attack the Balmiki basti. In Ajay Agarwal v. Union of India (supra),the Supreme Court observed that it was not necessary that each conspirator must know all thedetails of the scheme or be a participant at every stage. In Abuthagir v. State (supra), it wasexplained as under:"In the case of conspiracy there cannot be any direct evidence. The ingredients of theoffence are that there should be an agreement between persons who are alleged toconspire and the said agreement should be for doing an illegal act or for doing byillegal means an act which itself may not be illegal. Therefore, the essence of criminalconspiracy is an agreement to do an illegal act and such an agreement can be provedeither by direct evidence or by circumstantial evidence or by both, and it is a matterof common experience that direct evidence to prove conspiracy is rarely available.Therefore, the circumstances proved before, during and after the occurrence have tobe considered to decide about the complicity of the accused."94. In K.R. Purushothaman v. State of Kerala (supra), it was further highlighted as under:"To constitute a conspiracy, meeting of minds of two or more persons for doing anillegal act or an act by illegal means is the first and primary condition and it is notnecessary that all the conspirators must know each and every details of conspiracy.Neither it is necessary that every one of the conspirators takes active part in thecommission of each and every conspiratorial act. The agreement amongst theconspirators can be inferred by necessary implications. In most of the cases, theconspiracies are proved by the circumstantial evidence; as the conspiracy is seldoman open affair. The existence of conspiracy and its objects are usually deducted fromthe circumstance of the case and the conduct of the accused involved in theconspiracy."95. In separating out the incidents that took place on 19th and 21st April 2010, and by ignoring theprevailing tensions in the village on 20th April 2010, the trial Court failed to take into account the"circumstances proved before, during and after the occurrence". In light of this oversight and thejudicial position explained hereinabove, this Court cannot concur with the finding that noconspiracy was entered into by members of the Jat community to carry out a coordinated attack onthe Balmiki community of the village.96. It must also be mentioned that the non-recovery of jellies, gandasis, etc. was not particularlyunusual seeing as these are ordinary agricultural implements used by farmers and would have beenreadily available in the houses of the Jat community, which is the major farming community in thevillage. In fact, the Balmiki community being predominantly employed as labour on the fields of theJat farmers, it is unlikely that they themselves possessed such implements. Be that as it may, it isnot as if it would have been difficult for the Jat community to simply carry these implements back totheir houses after the attack.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/4097. The nature of the attack was also such that what was essentially done was to burn or destroy thehouses of the Balmikis and loot their properties. The presence of numerous brickbats at the site ofthe rioting demonstrated that a full-fledged attack was carried out on the Balmiki community. Inthis regard, the testimonies of PWs 3 and 4, i.e. the photographer and the videographer respectively,assume significance and this has not at all been discussed by the trial Court. PW-3 was thephotographer who took as many as 109 digital photographs of the scene of the rioting. They aremarked as Ex.PW-3/A-1 to A-109. A question put to PW-3 about trying to identify the houses ineach photograph was disallowed by the trial Court by correctly observing that "the witness can onlyprove the taking of the photographs at the spot but not the identity of the owners or the occupantsnot having participated in the investigation".98. This is where the evidence of PW-54 assumes significance. He himself visited each of thesehouses that were burnt or destroyed and drew up their scaled site plans. However, he was notconfronted with the photographs to show that they were not of the very houses of which the siteplans he had drawn up. It is not difficult to correlate the photographs with the houses for which siteplans were drawn up. For instance, the burning of the rickshaw used by Suman is proved on aphotograph (Ex.PW-3/A-9) taken inside the house of Tara Chand which clearly demonstrates thatthe mob had entered that particular house and burnt the properties there.99. Likewise, there are numerous photographs that show the properties inside the houses as havingbeen destroyed or burnt, charred walls and damaged articles/goods. These photographs were takeneither on 21st April 2010 itself or soon thereafter. There has been no attempt to show that any ofthese photographs were fabricated or false. They are not shown to be of houses other than those ofthe Balmikis. A heavy burden lay on the defence to show that these were not the photographs of theDalit houses that were burnt or destroyed. There is no attempt made in this regard at all. Thesephotographs were therefore an important corroborating piece of evidence for the prosecutionsversion of events that took place on 21st April 2010.100. Then we have the video footage taken by PW-4 who was also not cross- examined verythoroughly. The footage was taken on 22nd April 2010, i.e. the day after the incident. The videoclearly shows the extent of the damage done to the properties of the Dalits.101. This Court is unable to understand the conclusions drawn by the trial Court with regard to theselective targeting of the houses of the Balmikis. From the layout of the village, it is apparent thatthe Balmiki basti was located in the corner of the village abutting the fields which lay to the south ofthe village. On all other sides, the Balmiki basti was surrounded by the dwellings of the Jatcommunity. They were, therefore, soft targets. There was no difficulty at all for the Jats to identifythe Balmiki houses and attack them. In that sense, it could be said that the houses were attackedselectively.102. Once within the Balmiki basti, the Jat mob was indiscriminate in the havoc it sought to wreak.The damage and destruction that is evidenced from the record is widespread and, in the opinion ofthis Court, could not have been carried out by a small group of Jat youth in an altercation betweentwo groups as is speculated by the trial Court. There is no doubt that it was indeed a mob whichKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/41made a coordinated and premeditated attack on the Balmiki community. A conjoint analysis of thesite plans, the photographs, and the video footage provides a startling picture of the horrors faced bythe Balmiki community on 21 st April 2010.103. The conclusion of the trial Court that there was no criminal conspiracy is unsustainable in law.The trial Court failed to examine the photographs, videograph, and site plans in its analysis of theevents of 21st April 2010 and erred in accepting the alternative version of the incident on 21 st April2010 as put forth by the defence. This part of the finding of the trial Court, therefore, deserves to beset aside by this Court. This part of the finding of the trial Court, therefore, deserves to be set asideby this Court.Unlawful assembly with a common object104. The trial Court has concluded that since the burning of houses belonging to the Balmikicommunity was selective, it could not be said that an unlawful assembly had formed with thecommon object of destroying the properties of the Balmiki community as a whole. This Court wouldfirst like to highlight that the Supreme Court, in Pandurang Chandrakant Mhatre v. State ofMaharashtra (supra), identified two essential ingredients of the offence under Section 149 IPC as:(i) Commission of an offence by any members of an unlawful assembly; and(ii) Such offence must been committed in prosecution of the common object of that assembly ormust be such as the members of that assembly knew it to be likely to be committed.105. The offence under Section 149 IPC was further characterised by the Supreme Court in Md.Ankoos v. Public Prosecutor, High Court of A.P. (supra) in the following manner:"....Section 149 IPC creates constructive liability i.e. a person who is a member of theunlawful assembly is made guilty of the offence committed by another member of thesame assembly in the circumstances mentioned in the Section, although he may havehad no intention to commit that offence and had done no overt act except hispresence in the assembly and sharing the common object of that assembly. The legalposition is also fairly well settled that because of a mere defect in language or in thenarration or in form of the charge, the conviction would not be rendered bad ifaccused has not been affected thereby." (emphasis supplied)106. It is also relevant, in the present case, to consider the difference between the concepts ofcommon object and common intention. The nuanced difference between these two concepts hasbeen brought to light in Rabindra Mahto v. State of Jharkhand (supra) as under:"Under Section 149 IPC, if the accused is a member of an unlawful assembly, thecommon object of which is to commit a certain crime, and such a crime is committedby one or more of the members of that assembly, every person who happens to be amember of that assembly would be liable for the commission of the crime being aKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/42member of it irrespective of the fact whether he has actually committed the criminalact or not. There is a distinction between the common object and common intention.The common object need not require prior concert and a common meeting of mindsbefore the attack, and an unlawful object can develop after the assembly gatheredbefore the commission of the crime at the spot itself. There need not be prior meetingof the mind. It would be enough that the members of the assembly which constitutesfive or more persons have common object and that they acted as an assembly toachieve that object. In substance, Section 149 makes every member of the commonunlawful assembly responsible as a member for the act of each and all merely becausehe is a member of the unlawful assembly with common object to be achieved by suchan unlawful assembly. At the same time, one has to keep in mind that mere presencein the unlawful assembly cannot render a person liable unless there was a commonobject and that is shared by that person. The common object has to be found and canbe gathered from the facts and circumstances of each case." (emphasis supplied)107. In State of U.P. v. Dan Singh (supra), the Supreme Court made reference to the decision in Laljiv. State of U.P. (1989) 1 SCC 437 wherein it was observed that the "common object of the unlawfulassembly can be gathered from the nature of the assembly, arms used by them and the behaviour ofthe assembly at or before scene of the occurrence. It is an inference to be deduced from the facts andcircumstances of each case". The Supreme Court went on to observe:"What has to be seen is whether the basic features of the occurrences have beensimilarly viewed and/or described by the witnesses in a manner which tallies with theoutcome of the riot, viz., the injuries sustained by the victims and the number ofpeople who are attacked and killed. Before we deal with the testimony of thesewitnesses, it will be important to bear in mind that in the present case the convictionis being sought under Section 302 I.P.C. with the aid of Section 149 I.P.C. The twoessential ingredients of this Section are that there must be a commission of anoffence by any member of unlawful assembly and that such offence must becommitted in prosecution of common object of that assembly or must be such as themembers of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed. It is also a well-settledlaw (see Masalti vs State of Uttar Pradesh, AIR 1965 SC 202) that it is not necessaryfor the prosecution to prove which of the members of the unlawful assembly didwhich or what act. In fact as observed in Lalji's case (supra) "while overt act andactive participation may indicate common intention of the person perpetrating thecrime, the mere presence in the unlawful assembly may fasten vicariously criminalliability under Section 149"."108. The following observations of the Supreme Court in this regard in its decision in Masalti v.State of U.P. (supra) are instructive:"Then it is urged that the evidence given by the witnesses conforms to the sameuniform pattern and since no specific part is assigned to all the assailants, thatevidence should not have been accepted. This criticism again is not well founded.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/43Where a crowd of assailants who are members of an unlawful assembly proceeds tocommit an offence of murder in pursuance of the common object of the unlawfulassembly, it is often not possible for witnesses to describe accurately the part playedby each one of the assailants. Besides, if a large crowd of persons armed withweapons assaults the intended victims, it may not be necessary that all of them haveto take part in the actual assault. In the present case, for instance, several weaponswere carried by different members of the unlawful assembly, but it appears that theguns were used and that was enough to kill 5 persons. In such a case, it would beunreasonable to contend that because the other weapons carried by the members ofthe unlawful assembly were not used, the story in regard to the said weapons itselfshould be rejected. Appreciation of evidence in such a complex case is no doubt adifficult task; but Criminal Courts have to do their best in dealing with such cases andit is their duty to sift the evidence carefully and decide which part of it is true andwhich is not."109. It is clear in the present case that an unlawful assembly comprising members of the Jatcommunity was formed with the common object of setting fire to the properties of the Balmikicommunity and perpetrating violence against them, as it stands established that the members ofsaid unlawful assembly came armed with stones and oil cans as well as lathis, jellies andgandasiswhich, in the present context, may be considered deadly weapons. The common object ofthe unlawful assembly was to teach the Balmiki community a lesson. The manner in which theoffences were carried out clearly indicates that the mob sought to intimidate the Balmiki communityand subjected them to physical and mental violence as spoken to by several PWs. Section 149 IPC is,therefore, clearly attracted.110. The causal link between the incidents of 19th and 21st April 2010 has already been discussedand in that context, it is apparent that the mob came armed with the intention of exacting revengeon the Balmiki community. Many witnesses have spoken of an atmosphere of fear having grippedthe village and of groups of boys from the Jat community roaming around the village, issuing threatsto members of the Balmiki community. Thus, the Court is satisfied that the common object in thepresent case was to teach the members of the Balmiki community a lesson and this has been fullyachieved by the accused persons. Therefore, this Court concludes that Section 149 IPC standsattracted in the present case.Applicability of the POA Act111. The accused persons in the present case were also charged with having committed offencespunishable under the POA Act. The said legislation has been enacted with the purpose of protectingmembers of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe communities from caste-based atrocitiesperpetrated against them. Article 341 of the Constitution of India empowers the President to specify,with respect to any State, after consultation with the Governor of that State, by public notification,the castes, races, or tribes which shall be deemed to be Scheduled Castes in relation to that State. Inpursuance of this power, the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 was promulgated whichspecified in its Schedule the deemed Scheduled Castes with respect to each State. Section 3 of theKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/44Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976 introduced an altogethernew Schedule to replace the earlier one wherein the Scheduled Castes in the State of Haryana werealso listed in Part V. The Balmiki caste is listed under Entry No.2 of Part V as a Scheduled Caste.Therefore, it is beyond contention that offences committed against members of the Balmikicommunity would attract the provisions of the POA Act.112. The charges under the POA Act in the present case were under clauses (x) and (xv) of Section3(1) POA Act and clauses (iii), (iv), and (v) of Section 3(2) POA Act. The relevant clauses, as theystood at the time of the incident and prior to amendment, read as under:"3. (1) Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,--xxxxx(x) intentionally insults or intimidates with intent to humiliate a member of aScheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe in any place within public view;xxxxx(xv) forces or causes a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe to leave hishouse, village or other place of resident, shall be punishable with imprionsment for aterm which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to five years andwith fine.(2) Whoever, not being a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,--xxxxx(iii) commits mischief by fire or any explosive substance intending to cause orknowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause damage to any property belonging toa member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe, shall be punishable withimprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which mayextend to seven years and with fine;(iv) commits mischief by fire or any explosive substance intending to cause orknowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause destruction of any building which isordinarily used as a place of worship or as a place for human dwelling or as a placefor custody of the property by a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe,shall be punishable with imprisonment for life and with fine;(v) commits any offence under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) punishable withimprisonment for a term of ten years or more against a person or property on theground that such person is a member of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe orsuch property belongs to such member, shall be punishable with imprisonment forKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/45life and with fine;xxxxx"Section 3(1)(x) POA Act113. The Court proposes to first examine Section 3(1)(x) POA Act which talks of the offence ofintentionally insulting or intimidating "with an intent to humiliate" a member of the SC at "anyplace within public view". In the present case, a large number of phrases and words uttered bymembers of the Jat community at the time of the attack on the members of the Balmiki communityhave been referred to by PWs in their depositions in the Court. For some reason, however, in theirearlier statements under Section 161 Cr PC, none of the witnesses referred to any insulting wordsspoken by any of the members of the Jat community. The trial Court has, therefore, disbelieved thePWs to this extent and viewed this as an improvement over the previous statements given in theCourt.114. In the present case, there are two kinds of insults with the intention to humiliate that have beenadverted to by the prosecution - one is the use of objectionable words to describe the members of theBalmiki community and the other is the act of dancing naked in front of the houses of the Balmikicommunity that were being burnt. While the act of speaking insulting words was not adverted to byany of the PWs in their initial statements to the police, as far as the act of dancing naked isconcerned, only nine witnesses appear to have adverted to it and that too not against all the accused.While Sushil (PW-25) has named A-20 and A-13, PW-30 has named only A-28. Vicky (PW-42) hasnamed A-27. Amar Lal (CW-1) also speaks of this but does not name anyone in particular. The otherfive witnesses, i.e. PWs 28, 40, 43, 47, and 50, have not named any accused in particular as havingdanced naked. Therefore, the evidence available on the record is not sufficient to find any of theaccused persons guilty of the offence under Section 3(1)(x) POA Act.Section 3(1)(xv) POA Act115. The offence under Section 3(1)(xv) POA Act is one committed by a person, not being one whobelongs to a Scheduled Caste, who forces or causes a member of a Scheduled Caste to leave hishouse, village, or other place of residence. There is abundant evidence to show that at least 254Balmiki families ended up leaving village Mirchpur and sought shelter in the farmhouse of one VedPal Tanwar. This was clearly due to the attack which they had suffered at the hands of the Jatcommunity mob which had burnt their houses and killed the two deceased. Even the arrival ofpolice reinforcements was not enough to placate their fears and given the conduct of the Jatcommunity and inaction of the police officials, the members of the Balmiki community of villageMirchpur had little choice but to flee the village. Numerous witnesses have spoken of this. The trialCourt itself has noted how, even while deposing before the trial Court, many of these witnesses camefrom Ved Pal Tanwars farmhouse where they were residing at the time.116. Consequently, the Court has no hesitation in holding that the offence under Section 3(1)(xv)POA Act is made out qua some of the accused in the present case to whom notices have been issuedKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/46as it is their collective act of violence that has compelled at least 254 families of the Balmikicommunity to leave Mirchpur. As will be noticed hereafter, many of those families continue toremain at Ved Pal Tanwars farmhouse awaiting rehabilitation and reparation. They have been tooscared to return to Mirchpur. Thus, the offence under Section 3(1)(xv) POA Act stands establishedbeyond reasonable doubt and the trial Courts finding to the contrary is plainly erroneous.Section 3(2)(iii) and (iv) POA Act117. To begin with, the Court wishes to draw a distinction between Section 3(2)(iii) and (iv) POA Act.While Section 3(2)(iii) deals with the offence of committing mischief by fire or any explosivesubstance with both the intention and knowledge that such act would cause damage to any propertybelonging to a member of a Scheduled Caste, Section 3(2)(iv) adds a further aspect to the saidoffence by requiring the accused persons to both intend and know that, by that act, destructionwould be caused of any building used as a place of worship or for dwelling or for the custody of theproperty of a Scheduled Caste.118. The distinction in the sentences for the two offences is stark. For the offence under Section3(2)(iii), the minimum sentence is six months but the maximum is seven years whereas for Section3(2)(iv) there is only one sentence provided, i.e. imprisonment for life together with fine.Consequently, the word destruction occurring in Section 3(2)(iv) has to be given a strictconstruction and, in the considered view of this Court, should be interpreted to mean that the entirebuilding would have to be destroyed making it uninhabitable after being set on fire. Whether in factthe building has been, on account of the fire, been so completely destroyed so as to render ituninhabitable, will obviously be a matter for evidence. Anything short of complete destruction byfire would be covered under Section 3(2)(iii).119. In the present case, the photographic and videographic evidence available on the record showthat in many of the houses of the members of the Balmiki community that witnessed arson, thereare charred remains of the belongings and movable effects. Furthermore, the site plan (Ex.PW-54/B) showing the layout of the Balmiki basti, which has been found to be correct by the trialCourt, together with the individual scaled site plans (Ex. PW-54/A1 to A33), shows that as many as33 houses were burnt or damaged. However, it is noticed that not all the houses which were burnthave been completely destroyed. The photographs show that the houses of the deceased Tara Chand,his wife Kamala (PW-50) and Dhoop Singh (PW-29) were completely destroyed so as to renderthem uninhabitable. Consequently, as far as the burning of those houses is concerned, the offenceunder Section 3(2)(iv) stands attracted and as regards the burning of and damage caused to theother Balmiki houses, the offence under Section 3(2)(iii) is made out.Section 3(2)(v) POA Act120. As regards the charge under Section 3(2)(v), the defence has sought to challenge theapplicability of the provision on the ground that the prosecution has failed to establish that theoffences committed against victims belonging to the Balmiki community were perpetrated againstthem specifically due to their being Balmiki. It is pointed out that the charge under Section 3(2)(v),Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/47as it stood prior to its amendment with effect from 26th January 2016, could be brought home onlywhen it was shown that the offence has been committed "on the ground that such person is amember of a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe or such property belongs to such member".Reliance is placed on the decision in Asharfi v. State of U.P. (2018) 1 SCC 742 to aver that unless theessential conditions for the applicability of the POA Act are met, any conviction thereunder wouldsuffer illegality and would have to be set aside.121. It is pertinent to note that by Act No.1 of 2016 which came into force on 26th January 2016,Section 3(2)(v) stands amended to the effect that mere knowledge on the part of the perpetrator thatthe victim belongs to a Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe would be sufficient to attract thecharge thereunder. However, the present case is governed by the provision as it stood prior to theamendment given that it occurred in the year 2010. Therefore, the burden is on the prosecution inthe present case to prove that the offences against the members of the Balmiki community wereperpetrated on the ground that they belonged to the Balmiki caste.122. It is submitted on behalf of the defence that in the present case, the prosecution has notestablished that the accused persons sought to commit crimes specifically directed against membersof the Balmiki community. Reference was made to the decisions in State of A.P. v. ViswanadulaChetti Babu (2010) 15 SCC 103; Dinesh @ Buddha v. State of Rajasthan (2006) 3 SCC 771; andMasumsha Hasanasha Musalman v. State of Maharashtra (2000) 3 SCC 557.123. The Court finds no merit in the above submissions. The cross-examination of the PWs hasbrought out the fact that the victims belonged to the Balmiki community. This was not underchallenge at any stage during the trial. Furthermore, the depositions of the various PWs show thatthere was no doubt in the minds of the perpetrators that the victims were members of a ScheduledCaste community. In fact, it is evident that they had arrived at the Balmiki basti armed with variousdeadly weapons with the intention of teaching the members of the Balmiki community a lesson inretaliation for the incident which occurred on 19th April 2010. The conduct of the accused personsclearly indicates that their attack on the Balmiki community was perpetrated on the ground thatsuch the victims were members of a Scheduled Caste.124. Furthermore, as has been rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the complainants, thisissue about the POA Act not being applicable was never raised at any stage before the trial Court.Not only was the FIR in this case registered for offences punishable under the POA Act read withprovisions of the IPC, the charge sheet itself contained references to the POA Act. The trial has beenconducted in a Special Court designated to hear cases under the POA Act. In fact, the trial wastransferred to the Special Court on the directions of the Supreme Court as noted hereinbefore. Thecharges framed against the accused included those under the POA Act and this was again notchallenged by any of the accused.125. It was clear throughout the trial that while the accused persons belonged to the Jat community,the victims belonged to the Balmiki community. This was never in doubt. It was also never in doubtthat the Balmikis are notified as a Scheduled Caste in the State of Haryana. The defence themselveshave spoken to the fact that the victims received compensation under the POA Act. Consequently,Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/48the Court rejects the plea of the defence questioning the applicability of Section 3(2)(v) POA Act forthe first time in this Court.126. In the judgment of the trial Court, there appears to be some confusion in this regard. While thetrial Court has convicted A-20, A-34, and A-38 under Section 3(2)(v) POA Act, it has not done soqua the other accused persons based on its reasoning that what was perpetrated against the victimsfrom the Balmiki community was not, in fact, an offence motivated by caste hatred. This Court isunable to subscribe to such reasoning. It is evident from the material on the record that themembers of the Jat community had hatched a conspiracy to attack the Balmiki community anddeliberately targeted them by going to their basti. It cannot be claimed that the accused persons didnot know who they were attacking.127. As has already been observed, this was an act of revenge perpetrated by the Jat community inretaliation to the perceived insult dealt to them by members of the Balmiki community on 19th April2010. It also stands established that rioting on 21st April 2010 was sparked when A-25 ran throughthe main gali of the village at 8 am whilst raising a false alarm that he and A-34 had been attackedby the boys from the Balmiki community. Even accepting that the Jats began attacking at around 9to 9:30 am, there was enough time for preparation by the Jat community mob to plan an attack onthe Balmiki basti. Such planning is evidenced by the fact that they had brought oil cans as deposedby Gulaba (PW-48) and rehris full of stones. The male members of the Jat community met in the Jatchaupal and, upon being instigated by A-37 (the SHO of PS Narnaund), surrounded and attackedthe Balmiki basti and the women and children there who had been left alone with the males havingassembled at the Balmiki chaupal on being instructed to do so by A-37.128. Notice has not been issued to A-37 (acquitted) in the present appeals and therefore, it is notnecessary to examine his role in any great detail. It would suffice to say that there is abundantevidence to show that the Jat community were the aggressors and were not merely reacting toprovocation by the Balmiki community as has been opined by the trial Court. The fact that membersof the Balmiki community were themselves throwing stones cannot be seen as anything other thanthem acting in self-defence against an organised and well-planned attack by the accused persons.129. It was not one or two houses but several which were burnt. Therefore, the attempt tocharacterise the incident as a mere dispute between certain individuals and not an instance ofcaste-based violence is futile. The intent was clearly to intimidate and subjugate the members of theBalmiki community so as to teach them a lesson for the incident of 19 th April 2010. The houses ofthe Balmiki community were deliberately targeted. The Jat mob was successful in setting fire tomultiple houses and belongings of the Balmiki community.Section 8 POA Act130. It was submitted by Mr. M.N. Dudeja, learned counsel for some of the accused, that there canbe only one set of rules and standards of proof of crime when it comes to trials in criminal casesunless the statute provides for anything specifically applicable to a particular case or class of cases.In this regard, reliance was placed on the decision in Kailash Gour v. State of Assam (2012) 2 SCCKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/4934.131. In this context, it would be pertinent to refer to Section 8 POA Act which, at the relevant time,read as under:"8. Presumption as to offences:- In prosecution for an offence under this Chapter, if itis proved that -(a) the accused rendered any financial assistance to a person accused of or reasonablysuspected of, committing, an offence under this Chapter, the Special Court shallpresume, unless the contrary is proved, that such person had abetted the offence;(b) a group of persons committed an offence under this Chapter and if it is provedthat the offence committed was a sequel to any existing dispute regarding land or anyother matter, it shall be presumed that the offence was committed in furtherance ofthe common intention or in prosecution of the common object."132. Section 8(b) is of particular relevance in the present case since it makes specific reference to agroup of persons committing an offence as a sequel to an existing dispute regarding land "or anyother matter". In such a scenario, it is stipulated that the presumption is drawn as regards thecommon intention and prosecution of the common object. In the context of the incident of 19 thApril 2010 and the incident that occurred on the morning of 21st April 2010, the presumption underSection 8(b) stands attracted. In that view of the matter, the decision in Kailash Gour v. State ofAssam (supra) is of no assistance to the accused in the present case.This Court's findings with respect to the POA Act133. To summarise, this Court finds that the following aspects of the incident of 21st April 2010 havebeen established:(i) There was a deliberate targeting of the houses of the members of the Balmiki community bymembers of the Jat community;(ii) That this was an instance of caste-based violence meant to teach the Balmiki community a lessonfor the perceived insults to the Jat community on 19th and 21st April 2010;(iii) That the members of the Jat community had planned their attack in advance and had come tothe Balmiki basti armed with oil cans, jellies, gandasis, lathis, and rehris filled with stones;(iv) That the properties of the Balmiki community were burnt and looted and their belongingsdestroyed as is evidenced by the photographs and the videograph on the record.134. The Court is, therefore, of the view that the finding of the trial Court that this was not aninstance of violence driven by caste hatred is unsustainable and is hereby set aside. This Court isKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/50satisfied that the prosecution has been able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offencespunishable under Section 3(1)(xv) POA Act and Sections 3(2)(iii), (iv), and (v) POA Act standattracted qua some of the accused persons. The Court also rejects the plea that the prosecution hasnot established that the victims of the violence were members of the Balmiki community as this facthas never been questioned.Leading questions135. Contentions have been raised regarding the leading questions put to many witnesses by thelearned SPP in the trial Court. In this regard, the legal position as set out in Sat Paul v. DelhiAdministration (supra) may be recapitulated as under:"41......another equally important object of cross-examination is to elicit admissionsof facts which would help build the case of the cross- examiner. When a party withthe leave of the court, confronts his witness with his previous inconsistent statement,he does so in the hope that the witness might revert to what he had stated previously.If the departure from the prior statement is not deliberate but is due to faultymemory or a like cause, there is every possibility of the witness veering round to hisformer statement. Thus, showing faultiness of the memory in the case of such awitness would be another object of cross-examining and contradicting him by a partycalling the witness. In short, the rule prohibiting a party to put questions in themanner of cross-examination or in a leading form to his own witness is relaxed notbecause the witness has already forfeited all right to credit but because from hisantipathetic attitude or otherwise, the court feels that for doing justice, his evidencewill be more fully given, the truth more effectively extricated and his credit moreadequately tested by questions put in a more pointed, penetrating and searchingway."51. From the above conspectus, it emerges clear that even in a criminal prosecutionwhen a witness is cross-examined and contradicted with the leave of the court, by theparty calling him, his evidence cannot, as a matter of law, be treated as Washed offthe record altogether. It is for the Judge of fact to consider in each case whether as aresult of such cross-examination and contradiction, the witness stands thoroughlydiscredited or can still be believed in regard to a part of his testimony. If the Judgefinds that in the process, the credit of the witness has not been completely shaken, hemay, after reading and considering the evidence of the witness, as a whole, with duecaution and care, accept, in the light of the other evidence on the record, that part ofhis testimony which he finds to be creditworthy and act upon it. If in a given case, thewhole of the testimony of the witness is impugned, and in the process, the witnessstands squarely and totally discredited, the Judge should, as matter of prudence,discard his evidence in toto."136. The position was further clarified by the Supreme Court in Varkey Joseph v. State of Kerala(supra) thusly:Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/51"11. Leading question to be one which indicates to the witnesses the real or supposedfact which the prosecutor (plaintiff) expects and desires to have confirmed by theanswer. Leading question may be used to prepare him to give the answers to thequestions about to be put to him for the purpose of identification or to lead him to themain evidence or fact in dispute. The attention of the witness cannot be directed inChief examination to the subject of the enquiry/trial. The Court may permit leadingquestion to draw the attention of the witness which cannot otherwise by called to thematter under enquiry, trial or investigation. The discretion of the court must only becontrolled towards that end but a question which suggest to the witness, the answerthe prosecutor expects must not be allowed unless the witness, with the permission ofthe court, is declared hostile and cross- examination is directed thereafter in thatbehalf. Therefore, as soon as the witness has been conducted to the material portionof his examination, it is generally the duty of the prosecutor to ask the witness tostate the facts or to give his own account of the matter making him to speak as towhat he had seen. The prosecutor will not be allowed to frame his questions in such amanner that the witness by answering merely "yes" or "no" will give the evidencewhich the prosecutor wishes to elicit. The witness must account for what he himselfhad seen. Sections 145 and 154 of the Evidence Act are intended to provide for casesto contradict the previous statement of the witnesses called by the prosecution.Sections 143 and 154 provide the right to cross-examination of the witnesses by theadverse party even by leading questions to contradict answers given by the witnessesor to test the veracity or to drag the truth of the statement made by him..."137. When examined in light of the above decisions, in the present case, this Court finds that thequestions put by the learned SPP to the PWs were not actually in the nature of leading questions.Rather, these questions were put to the witnesses in order to refresh their memory. This Court findsthat these questions were not close- ended and did not impact the credibility of the witnessestestimonies. Therefore, the defences contention in this regard does not resonate with this Court.Eye witness testimonies138. Although the prosecution had cited 95 public witnesses to the incident of rioting on 21st April2010, only 43 ended up being examined as PWs. Only 22 of these 43 PWs supported the case of theprosecution while the remaining witnesses were declared hostile. Amar Lal (CW-1), the son ofdeceased Tara Chand, also supported the case of the prosecution.139. In its findings qua the reliability of these 23 witnesses, the trial Court has categorised them intothree classes: reliable, partly reliable, and unreliable. Sushil (PW-25) and Dhoop Singh (PW-29)have been termed to be reliable witnesses. Rajbir (PW-10), Sunita (PW-13), Santra (PW-30), Sheela(PW-32), Rani (PW-33), Sanjay (PW-36), Meena Kumar (PW-37), and Kamala (PW-50), on theother hand, were found to be unreliable witnesses. The testimonies of Sandeep (PW-28), Mahajan(PW-38), Sube Singh (PW-39), Vijender (PW-40), Vicky (PW-42), Dilbagh (PW-43), Sanjay(PW-44), Manoj (PW-45), Rajesh (PW-46), Satyawan (PW-47), Gulaba (PW-48), Pradeep (PW-49),and Amar Lal (CW-1) have all been deemed to be only partly reliable.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/52140. It is pertinent to note at the outset that the trial Court has also noticed that those PWs whowere residing at the farmhouse of Mr. Tanwar in the aftermath of the incident supported the case ofthe prosecution and have even to some extent identified the accused in the Court. On the otherhand, the PWs who continued to reside or returned to reside in the village after the incident did notsupport the prosecution case. The trial Court has observed that the reasons for this "may bemanifold, not excluding the possibility of their being won over".141. The trial Court orders of 23rd March, 29th March, 30th March, and 8th April 2011 reveal thateven at that stage, it was felt that the accused persons were trying to influence the PWs belonging tothe Balmiki community. In fact, Karan Singh (DW-13), who was the complainant in the incidentdated 19 th April 2010 and who would have been a valuable witness for the prosecution, ended upbeing examined as a witness for the defence. Furthermore, the other complainant who was severelyinjured in the aforesaid incident, viz. Veerbhan, never reached the trial Court and instead returnedto village Mirchpur without deposing in the trial.142. Coming to the testimonies of the PWs, many of them have spoken to the various aspects of theoffences committed by the unlawful assembly comprising the accused persons. These witnesses havecollectively identified all of the accused persons and have even spoken, in some instances, of thespecific acts perpetrated by certain accused persons. However, the trial Court has rejected the oculartestimony of these witnesses for a number of reasons. This Court, having considered the findings ofthe trial Court qua the eye witnesses, is unable to concur. Many of these reasons for rejection of theocular testimony are contrary to law and find no basis in the evidence on the record.143. It should be recalled that many of the PWs in the present case were most likely deposing in atrial for the first time and, as noted by the trial Court, were no doubt "overawed and intimidated" bythe piercing cross-examinations to which they were subjected. Furthemore, their depositions werebeing recorded after a considerable passage of time and, thus, there were bound to be discrepanciesnot only as to the time of occurrence but even as regards other minor details. In this regard, it wouldbe wise to keep in mind the observations of the Supreme Court in Ramesh v. State of U.P. (supra)that "minor contradictions, inconsistencies, exaggerations and embellishments in the testimonies ofthe eye witnesses were bound to be there. However, they by themselves do not decide the credibilityof the witness". This Court is, therefore, of the view that the testimonies of witnesses which areotherwise sound and reliable cannot be discarded for the reason that minor discrepancies orinconsistencies crop up.144. Coming to the question of determining membership of said unlawful assembly and the guilt quaeach of the accused persons, the trial Court has rejected the dock identification of accused personsmade by various PWs. This was done on the basis that such dock identifications by the witnesseswho have failed to mention the names of the accused persons in their statements to the police underSection 161 Cr PC were clear improvements and therefore unreliable and untrustworthy. The trialCourt, however, seems to have ignored the fact that many witnesses have stated that the police hadrefused to record the names of the accused persons identified by them.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/53145. It is unfair to characterise all these witnesses as untrustworthy when in fact it took a great dealof courage on their part to appear in the trial and speak up against the offences committed by thedominant caste. This Court is of the opinion that the inconsistencies and omissions highlighted bythe trial Court in rejecting the testimony of multiple PWs did not go to the heart of the matter in thepresent case. The core essence of the testimony of these witnesses remained unshaken in their crossexamination and and they were, therefore, reliable. In this context, the Court would like to refer tothe settled legal position as explained by the Supreme in Alamgir Sani v. State of Assam (supra):"Otherwise creditworthy and reliable evidence of a witness would not be rejectedmerely because a particular statement made by the witness before the Court does notfind place in statement recorded under S.161 Cr PC."146. In the opinion of this Court, an omission to mention certain aspects of the incident which findmention in their statements to the police recorded under Section 161 Cr PC would only be a materialcontradiction if it completely invalidates what was earlier stated to the police under Section 161 CrPC. In Kazeman v. State of West Bengal (supra), it was opined:"Only that omission is a contradiction which is inconsistent with what was statedduring the examination under S.161, CrPC. If what was not stated during theexamination under S.161 CrPC can co-exist with what was stated, it cannot be saidthat such omission would amount to contradiction"147. In its decision in C. Muniappan v. State of Tamil Nadu (supra), the Supreme Court observed:"71. It is settled proposition of law that even if there are some omissions,contradictions and discrepancies, the entire evidence cannot be disregarded. Afterexercising care and caution and sifting through the evidence to separate truth fromuntruth, exaggeration and improvements, the court comes to a conclusion as towhether the residuary evidence is sufficient to convict the accused. Thus, an undueimportance should not be attached to omissions, contradictions and discrepancieswhich do not go to the heart of the matter and shake the basic version of theprosecution's witness. As the mental abilities of a human being cannot be expected tobe attuned to absorb all the details of the incident, minor discrepancies are bound tooccur in the statements of witnesses.

Saravanan and Anr.)."Test Identification Parade148. The non-conduct of a TIP has also contributed to the trial Courts finding that the dockidentification of accused persons for the first time in Court could not be relied upon to arrive at aKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/54finding of guilt qua an accused person. In this regard, it would be pertinent to highlight the viewtaken by the Supreme Court in Santokh Singh v. Izhar Hussain (supra) that identification at a TIP"is not substantive evidence and it can only be used as a corroborative of the statement in court".Similarly, in Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi) (supra), the SupremeCourt held that "even where there is no previous TIP, the Court may appreciate the dockidentification as being above-board and more than conclusive" before noting that "it is dockidentification which is a substantive piece of evidence" while the TIP is only an aid to theinvestigation.149. In Mulla v. State of U.P. (supra), the Supreme Court explained as under:"The evidence of test identification is admissible under Section 9 of the IndianEvidence Act. The Identification parade belongs to the stage of investigation by thepolice. The question whether a witness has or has not identified the accused duringthe investigation is not one which is in itself relevant at the trial. The actual evidenceregarding identification is that which is given by witnesses in Court. There is noprovision in the Cr. P.C. entitling the accused to demand that an identification paradeshould be held at or before the inquiry of the trial. The fact that a particular witnesshas been able to identify the accused at an identification parade is only acircumstance corroborative of the identification in Court. Failure to hold testidentification parade does not make the evidence of identification in courtinadmissible, rather the same is very much admissible in law. Where identification ofan accused by a witness is made for the first time in Court, it should not form thebasis of conviction. The necessity for holding an identification parade can arise onlywhen the accused persons are not previously known to the witnesses. The whole ideaof a test identification parade is that witnesses who claim to have seen the culprits atthe time of occurrence are to identify them from the midst of other persons withoutany aid or any other source. The test is done to check upon their veracity. In otherwords, the main object of holding an identification parade, during the investigationstage, is to test the memory of the witnesses based upon first impression and also toenable the prosecution to decide whether all or any of them could be cited aseyewitnesses of the crime. The identification proceedings are in the nature of testsand significantly, therefore, there is no provision for it in the Code and the IndianEvidence Act, 1872. It is desirable that a test identification parade should beconducted as soon as possible after the arrest of the accused. This becomes necessaryto eliminate the possibility of the accused being shown to the witnesses prior to thetest identification parade. This is a very common plea of the accused and, therefore,the prosecution has to be cautious to ensure that there is no scope for making suchallegation. If, however, circumstances are beyond control and there is some delay, itcannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution. The identification parades are notprimarily meant for the Court. They are meant for investigation purposes. The objectof conducting a test identification parade is two- fold. First is to enable the witnessesto satisfy themselves that the accused whom they suspect is really the one who wasKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/55seen by them in connection with the commission of the crime. Second is to satisfy theinvestigating authorities that the suspect is the real person whom the witnesses hadseen in connection with the said occurrence. Therefore, the following principlesregarding identification parade emerge: (1) an identification parade ideally must beconducted as soon as possible to avoid any mistake on the part of witnesses; (2) thiscondition can be revoked if proper explanation justifying the delay is provided; and,(3) the authorities must make sure that the delay does not result in exposure of theaccused which may lead to mistakes on the part of the witnesses."150. In Pramod Mandal v. State of Bihar (supra), the position was explained as under:"It is neither possible nor prudent to lay down any invariable rule as to the periodwithin which a Test Identification Parade must be held, or the number of witnesseswho must correctly identify the accused, to sustain his conviction. These mattersmust be left to the Courts of fact to decide in the facts and circumstances of each case.If a rule is laid down prescribing a period within which the Test Identification Parademust be held, it would only benefit the professional criminals in whose cases thearrests are delayed as the police have no clear clue about their identity, they beingpersons unknown to the victims. They therefore, have only to avoid their arrest forthe prescribed period to avoid conviction. Similarly, there may be offences which bytheir very nature may be witnessed by a single witness, such as rape. The offendermay be unknown to the victim and the case depends solely on the identification bythe victim, who is otherwise found to be truthful and reliable. What justification canbe pleaded to contend that such cases must necessarily result in acquittal because ofthere being only one identifying witness? Prudence therefore demands that thesematters must be left to the wisdom of the courts of fact which must consider allaspects of the matter in the light of the evidence on record before pronouncing uponthe acceptability or rejection of such identification."151. Again, in Matru @ Girish Chandra v. State of U.P. (supra), it was observed:"Identification tests do not constitute substantive evidence. They are primarily meantfor the purpose of helping the investigating agency with an assurance that theirprogress with the investigation into the offence is proceeding on the right lines. Theidentification can only be used as corroborative of the statement in Court."152. In Sayed Darain Ahsan @ Darain v. State of West Bengal (2012) 4 SCC 352, the Supreme Courtmade the following observation regarding the necessity of a TIP in the context of the accused personbeing previously kown to the witnesses:".....the appellant and the four eye witnesses belonged to the same locality and thefour eye witnesses knew the appellant before the incident and were able toimmediately identify the appellant at the time of the incident. It is only if theappellant was a stranger to the eyewitnesses that the test identification parade wouldKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/56have been necessary at the time of investigation."153. The following observations by the Supreme Court in Munshi Singh Gautam v. State of M.P.(2005) 9 SCC 631 clarify the position succinctly:"It is trite to say that the substantive evidence is the evidence of identification incourt. Apart from the clear provisions of Section 9 of the Evidence Act, the position inlaw is well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court. The facts, which establish theidentity of the accused persons, are relevant under Section 9 of the Evidence Act. As ageneral rule, the substantive evidence of a witness is the statement made in court.The evidence of mere identification of the accused person at the trial for the first timeis from its very nature inherently of a weak character. The purpose of a prior testidentification, therefore, is to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of thatevidence. It is, accordingly, considered a safe rule of prudence to generally look forcorroboration of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of theaccused who are strangers to them, in the form of earlier identification proceedings.This rule of prudence, however, is subject to exception, when, for example, the courtis impressed by a particular witness on whose testimony it can safely rely, withoutsuch or other corroboration. The identification parades belong to the stage ofinvestigation, and there is no provision in the Code which obliges the investigationagency to hold or confers a right upon the accused to claim a test identificationparade. They do not constitute substantive evidence and these parades are essentiallygoverned by Section 162 of the Code. Failure to hold a test identification paradewould not make inadmissible the evidence of identification in court. The weight to beattached to such identification should be a matter for the courts of fact. Inappropriate cases it may accept the evidence of identification even without insistingon corroboration. [See Kanta Prashad v. Delhi Administration AIR 1958 SC 350,Vaikuntam Chandrappa v. State of A.P. AIR 1960 SC 1340, Budhsen v. State of U.P.(1970) 2 SCC 128 and Rameshwar Singh v. State of J&K (1971) 2 SCC 715]"154. Consequently, this Court is of the view that the mere fact that a TIP was not held in the presentcase would not vitiate the testimonies of the witnesses who have identified the assailants in theCourt.Delay in recording statements of witnesses155. The trial Court has also expressed reservations qua statements of witnesses recorded by thepolice a long time after the incident of rioting on 21 st April 2010 and has found them to be ofdoubtful veracity. This is unfair to the witnesses, many of whom are themselves victims who havesuffered injuries and damage to their properties. They had no control over the pace of theinvestigation and cannot be denied justice due to the police recording their statements at a laterdate.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/57Furthermore, merely because a witness belongs to the Balmiki community or may be closely relatedto a victim does not mean that such evidence should be disregarded per se.156. In Khurshid Ahmed v. State of J&K AIR 2018 SC 2457, the Supreme Court held as under:"28. If the evidence of an eyewitness, though a close relative of the victim, inspiresconfidence, it must be relied upon without seeking corroboration with minutematerial particulars. It is no doubt true that the Courts must be cautious whileconsidering the evidence of interested witnesses. In his evidence, the description ofthe incident by PW9 clearly portrays the way in which the accused attacked thedeceased causing fatal head injury as propounded by the prosecution. The testimonyof the father of deceased (PW9) must be appreciated in the background of the entirecase.29. In our opinion, the testimony of PW9 inspires confidence, and the chain of eventsand the circumstantial evidence thereof completely supports his statements which inturn strengthens the prosecution case with no manner of doubt. We have nohesitation to believe that PW9 is a 'natural' witness to the incident. On a carefulscrutiny, we find his evidence to be intrinsically reliable and wholly trustworthy. .....31. When analyzing the evidence available on record, Court should not adopt hypertechnical approach but should look at the broader probabilities of the case. Basing onthe minor contradictions, the Court should not reject the evidence in its entirety.Sometimes, even in the evidence of truthful witness, there may appear certaincontradictions basing on their capacity to remember and reproduce the minutedetails. Particularly in the criminal cases, from the date of incident till the day theygive evidence in the Court, there may be gap of years. Hence the Courts have to takeall these aspects into consideration and weigh the evidence. The discrepancies andcontradictions which do not go to the root of the matter, credence shall not be givento them. In any event, the paramount consideration of the Court must be to dosubstantial justice. We feel that the trial Court has adopted an hyper technicalapproach which resulted in the acquittal of the accused."Lapses in investigation157. The trial Court has discussed at length the lapses in the investigation by the police. As rightlypointed out in Ram Bihari Yadav v. State of Bihar (supra):"...the story of the prosecution will have to be examined de hors such omissions andcontaminated conduct of the officials otherwise the mischief which was deliberatelydone would be perpetuated and justice would be denied to the complainant party andthis would obviously shake the confidence of the people not merely in the lawenforcing agency but also in the administration of justice."Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/58158. In Budh Singh v. State of U.P. (2007) 10 SCC 496, it was explained that "the defectiveinvestigation in itself is no ground for according an acquittal of the accused". In Karnel Singh v.State of Madhya Pradesh (1995) 5 SCC 518, it was explained as under:"In the case of a defective investigation the Court has to be circumspect in evaluatingthe evidence and may have to adopt an active and analytical role to ensure that truthis found by having recourse to Section 311 or at a later stage also resorting to Section391 instead of throwing hands in the air in despair. It would not be right in acquittingan accused person solely on account of the defect; to do so would tantamount toplaying into the hands of the investigating officer if the investigation is designedlydefective."159. Again, in Dharmendrasinh @ Mansing Katansinh v. State of Gujarat (2002) 4 SCC 679, theSupreme Court observed as under:"13. The High Court has also referred to a decision reported in 2000 SCC (Crl.) 522Ambica Prasad and another v. State (Delhi Administration) in which this Courtobserved that faulty investigation or witnesses turning hostile may not ultimatelyaffect the merit of the case nor it could be a ground to disbelieve the statement of theprosecution witnesses.14. In our view the High Court taking into account the observations made in thedecision referred to above came to the conclusion that otherwise reliable statement ofthe witness PW-3 Ashaben could not be discarded or discredited even though therehad been any fault or negligence in conducting the investigation, that too by itself, benot sufficient to dislodge the prosecution case as a whole."160. The legal position that emerges is that while there may have been lapses in the investigationthat alone will not lead to an acquittal of the accused. All it does is put the Court on caution inevaluating the evidence. A faulty investigation does not ipso facto result in affecting the credibility ofPWs and completely discarding their evidence.161. For instance, in the present case, there was no scaled site plan of the entire village drawn up forreasons best known to the police. Fortunately, the unscaled site plan of the entire village(Ex.PW-54/B) was not seriously questioned by the defence except for giving a preposteroussuggestion that it was drawn up at the PS, without PW-54 even visiting the village. That was ofcourse denied by PW-54. Other than this, there was no attempt even before this Court by the learnedcounsel for the defence to question that site plan.162. Also, it should have been possible for the photographs to be shown to PWs in order to helpthem identify their own houses in those photographs. This may be at best a lapse on the part of theSPP who conducted the prosecution but did not affect the case because the authenticity of thesephotographs was never questioned by the defence.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/59163. The cross-examination of PW-3 who took those photographs shows that there was no challengeto the fact that on the very day of the incident, i.e. 21st April 2010, these photographs were taken orthat these were of the houses of the Balmikis in the Balmiki basti of the village. Perhaps even thevideograph could have been shown to the PWs and they could have been asked to identify theirhouses from the video. But again, this per se did not impact the credibility of these witnesses or evenfor that matter the videograph that has been made by PW-4.164. Consequently, the Court is unable to subscribe to the trial Courts opinion that defects in theinvestigation in this case substantially weakened the case of the prosecution.Conduct of witnesses165. The trial Court has disregarded the evidence of PWs 42 to 50 only on the ground that none ofthem came forward to save the two deceased although they were related to them. However, this failsto acknowledge that in a situation such as the one that existed on 21st April 2010, the Balmikis werein a vulnerable position, were disoriented and paralysed by fear. That they purportedly did not stepforward to save the victims who were being attacked by the accused persons should not be heldagainst them. As rightly pointed out by the learned counsel for the complainants, the settledprinciple of law is that there can be no speculation about how a person should react in a particularcontingency. This has been explained in Jai Shree Yadav v. State of U.P. (2005) 9 SCC 788 thus:"21. PW-3's evidence was challenged by the defence in the courts below as well asbefore this Court on the ground that he is a partisan and biased witness being the sonof the deceased Abid Ali. This fact of course is not disputed by the witness because itis the case of the prosecution itself that the deceased Abid Ali was inimical to accusedpersons for various reasons mentioned hereinabove. PW1's presence at the place andtime of the incident was challenged by learned counsel for the accused before usprimarily on the ground that if really he was present at the time of incident he wouldhave tried to protect his father and there was no material to show that any such thingwas done by this witness. It was also pointed out from his evidence that though hisfather was profusely bleeding the clothes of this witness were not blood stained whichindicated that he never even touched the body of his father which is an unnaturalconduct on the part of a son present at the time of the murder of his father. Thiswitness when cross examined in this regard, admitted that since his father had diedalready he did not carry the body of his father nor did he touch the body of his father.In our opinion different people react differently to a given situation and from the factthat this witness did not choose to fall on the body of his father or carry his dead bodyfrom where it was lying, by itself cannot be a ground to reject his evidence. We havealready accepted the fact that the complaint in question was lodged by this witnesssoon after the incident in question and FW-8 in his evidence has spoken to thecomplaint being lodged by this witness and he being present throughout theinvestigation proceedings at the spot on that day. His presence at the place ofincident also cannot be treated as a chance presence inasmuch as he is a resident ofthat village though his father stays in Deoria. Learned counsel for the appellantKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/60submitted that it is an admitted fact that this witness has stated that he is aneducated person and according to this witness the complaint in question was notwritten down by him but by his brother- in-law which is also an unnatural conductindicating that he might not have been present at the time of incident. We do notthink this could also be a ground to suspect the presence of this witness at the timeand place of incident."Statements before the Commission of Inquiry166. The testimonies of certain witnesses have been discredited by the trial Court on the ground thatthey had spoken differently before the Commission of Inquiry (CoI) constituted to look into thematter. This is despite the well settled legal position that statements made to a CoI cannot be reliedupon in a trial. Section 6 Commission of Inquiry Act (CoIA) reads as under:"6. Statements made by persons to the Commission. No statement made by a, personin the course of giving evidence before the Commission shall subject him to, or beused against him in, any civil or criminal proceeding except a prosecution for givingfalse evidence by such statement:Provided that the statement-(a) is made in reply to a question which he is required by the Commission to answer,or(b) is relevant to the subject matter of the inquiry."167. The Supreme Court, in Kehar Singh v. State (Delhi Admn.) (supra), held asunder:"Statements made by witness before a Commission could be used in a criminal trialneither for the purpose of cross-examination to contradict the witness nor to impeachhis credit."168. Further, the High Court of Orissa, in Rajat Kumar Das @ Dipu Das v.Republic of India 2004 Cri LJ 224 (SJ-Orissa), held as under:"Section 6 of the Commissions of Inquiry Act guarantees immunity to a witness. Itclearly stipulates that a person making a statement in course of examination beforethe Commission enjoys certain protection, inasmuch as no statement made by aperson in course of giving evidence before the Commission shall subject him to, or beused against him, in a civil or criminal proceeding. This protection is guaranteed inorder to create confidence on the person to speak truth nothing but the truth beforethe Commission and not to hide anything. At the same time, the person is alsoKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/61cautioned that taking advantage of such immunity if he makes a false statementbefore the Commission, he would be prosecuted. The "statement" as per Section 6 ofthe Act is explained to be a "statement" made in reply to a question which he isrequired by the Commission to answer. Perusal of Sections 145, 155 and 157 of theEvidence Act clearly indicates that a previous statement can only be used forcontradiction or for corroboration. The restrictions imposed under Section 6 of theCommissions of Inquiry Act stipulating that a statement made by a person before theCommission cannot be used either for the purpose of contradiction incross-examination of the said witness or for the purpose of impeaching hiscredibility, is aimed to protect the witness and to provide immunity to the saidperson"169. Consequently, this Court is of the opinion that the trial Court was not justified in rejecting thetestimonies of the PWs in question because they contradicted their statements before the CoI.Scientific evidence v. ocular evidence170. That the forensic evidence did not reveal the presence of hydrocarbons of petroleum would notdiscredit the ocular testimony of the PWs which finds corroboration from the photographic andvideographic evidence available on the record. It cannot be denied that many houses in the Balmikibasti were burnt with some being damaged beyond recognition. Several PWs deposed that the Jatmob were carrying oil cans and were setting fire to the properties of the Balmikis. The trial Courtitself has noted that the manner in which samples were collected from the scene of rioting was lessthan satisfactory. No specialist team was called and the extremely intricate job of collection ofsamples for forensic analysis was left to a team of non-experts. Thus, it is not beyond the realms ofpossibility that the purity of the samples tested by the FSL was compromised.171. Doubts have also been expressed about the truthfulness of a number of PWs for the reason thattheir testimonies regarding the injuries suffered by them lack corroboration from the medicalevidence. The trial Court proceeded on a surmise that the victims might have inflicted damage totheir properties and injured themselves in the hope of claiming compensation from the Governmentof Haryana. Nothing on the record substantiates such a presumption. This Court, in its decision inDalip Kumar v. State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) (decision dated 7th March 2014 by a Division Bench ofthis Court in Crl.A.749/2010), has recognized that ocular testimony which is categorical and candidcannot be rejected on the ground that it lacks corroboration from the forensic evidence.172. The defence in these appeals have also sought to argue that oral evidence canot be allowed tooverride the scientific evidence on the record. Reliance is placed on the decision in Gajraj v. State(NCT of Delhi) 2011 (10) SCALE 695. On the contrary, the Court finds that the law in this regard hasbeen clearly explained in Gangadhar Behera v. State of Orissa (2002) 8 SCC 381 where the SupremeCourt cautioned that "it would be erroneous to accord undue primacy to the hypothetical answers ofthe medical witnesses to exclude the eye witnesses accounts which had to be tested independentlyand not treated as the variable keeping the medical evidence as the constant". Reference may also bemade to the decisions in State of U.P. v. Krishna Gopal (1988) 4 SCC 302 where it was held thatKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/62"where the eye witness account is found credible and trustworthy, medical evidence pointing toalternative possibilities is not accepted as conclusive". Observations to the same effect have beenmade in State of Haryana v. Bhagirath (1999) 5 SCC 96; Thaman Kumar v. State of Union Territoryof Chandiragh (2003) 6 SCC 380; Ram Swaroop v. State of Rajasthan (supra); and MallappaSiddappa Alakanur v. State of Karnataka (supra).173. In deisbelieving the allegations that oil was sprinkled on the deceased victims, the trial Courthas taken into consideration that the post-mortem reports of the deceased showed that they hadexpired due to ordinary burns and not due to oil burns. However, as explained in Nanhau Ram v.State of M.P. AIR 1988 SC 912 and Bhajju @ Karan Singh v. State of M.P. (2012) 4 SCC 327, amedical opinion cannot wipe out the direct testimonies of a number of witnesses. Again, in Rakeshv. State of M.P. (2011) 10 SCALE 584, it was explained that ocular testimony of the witnesses has agreater evidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence, unless the medical evidence makes the ocularevidence improbable, which it does not in the present case.174. This Court, therefore, has no hesitation in concluding that the trial Court has erred in rejectingthe testimony of the PWs with regard to the burning of the houses in the Balmiki basti by theaccused persons due to the absence of hydrocarbons of petroleum in the forensic samples and lackof corroboration from medical evidence.Irrelevant considerations in rejecting testimony175. The trial Court also seems to have invoked a number of extraneous circumstances so as todisbelieve the testimonies of the PWs. This Court is unable to concur with its finding that victimswere raising false claims and deposing falsely in Court due to the promise of compensation made bythe Government of Haryana. Furthermore, the trial Court has cited the victims seeking shelter fromone Ved Pal Tanwar who supposedly had political ambitions as a reason to doubt the veracity oftheir claims. This reasoning again does not appeal to this Court. The Court is informed that many ofthe victims have not been able to return to the village even as of date. That the fear of persecutionpersists in the minds of these victims even eight years after the incident only goes to show that theState has failed to ensure their safety and well-being. Many of them have lost property andlivelihoods as a result of this incident and it would be cruel to blame them for their own fate. Theirtestimonies deserve the greatest regard and must be considered fully in the Courts determination ofthis case.176. There was no occasion for the trial Court to doubt the credibility of the PWs who were residentsof the village. They have spoken clearly and cogently about the events that transpired on 21st April2010. There is no material on the record which conclusively discredits their testimonies. Thecharacterisation of some of these witnesses as unreliable and untrustworthy appears to be withoutfoundation and, therefore, the Court rejects the trial Courts findings qua these witnesses.Numerical rule in respect of Section 149 IPCKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/63177. It has been submitted by learned counsel Mr. S. Rajan that many of the accused have not beenidentified by at least four witnesses as mandated by the decision of the Supreme Court in State ofU.P. v. Dan Singh (supra) and at least 50% of the independent witnesses as mandated by thedecision of the Supreme Court in Inder Singh v. State of Rajasthan (2015) 2 SCC 734.178. At this stage, the Court would like to discuss both these decisions at some length. In State ofU.P. v. Dan Singh (supra), a member of the accused party happened to get injured when a scufflebroke out between members of a marriage procession consisting of members of a Scheduled Caste(Doms) on the one hand and the so-calle upper caste residents of the village on the other. TheSupreme Court then observed that "a cry was raised that the Doms should be burnt and killed andthat is precisely what happened". The ensuing violence resulted in the death of 14 members of theDom community. Six of them were burnt after having locked themselves inside a house of one of thevictims. The other eight were chased down as the sought to flee and were mercilessly beaten andkilled.179. With 14 people having been killed, the Supreme Court held that it could not be said that anunlawful assembly having the common object of killing the Doms did not exist, even if the assemblyof villagers was initially lawful and weapons more lethal than sticks or stones had not been used.The Supreme Court also significantly stated in the context of Section 149 IPC that "just becausethere may be some inconsequential contradictions or exaggeration in the testimony of the eyewitnesses that should not be a ground to reject their evidence in its entirety". It was further pointedout that in cases of rioting, "where there are a large number of assailants and a number of witnesses,it is but natural that the testimony of the witnesses may not be identical. What has to be seen iswhether the basic features of the occurrence have been similarly viewed and/or described by thewitnesses in the manner which tallies with the outcome of the riot, viz., the injuries sustained by thevictims and the number of people who are attacked and killed". Furthermore, it was opined that forthe purposes of Section 149 IPC, it was not necessary for the prosecution to prove "which of themembers of the unlawful assembly did which or what act".180. The Supreme Court in State of U.P. v. Dan Singh (supra) was mindful of the observations madein Masalti v. State of U.P. (supra) and observed that:"... even though a very large number of members of the unlawful assembly had takenpart in the attack on the Doms, it would be safe if only those of the respondentsshould be held to be the members of the unlawful assembly who have beenspecifically identified by at least four eye witnesses."181. However, in the opinion of this Court, this observation cannot be said to be an inviolable rule oflaw and each case has to be considered in terms of the probative value of the evidence and notmerely a mathematical number. In that regard, the Supreme Courts observation in State ofMaharashtra v. Ramlal Devappa Rathod (2015) 15 SCC 77 that "evidence has to be weighed and notcounted as statutorily recognized in Section 134 of the Evidence Act" is of particular relevance.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/64182. In Inder Singh v. State of Rajasthan (supra), the Supreme Court was dealing with another caseinvolving mass killings pursuant to an unlawful assembly. The dispute was between co-villagers whowere known to each other. In this context, it was observed after referring to the decision in Masaltiv. State of U.P (supra) that "the normal test is that the conviction could be sustained only if it issupported by two or more witnesses who give a consistent account of the incident in question". Inview of the facts of that case, it was further observed that "since the accused persons and the sixmaterial eye witnesses in this case are co-villagers, it is expected that at least three eye witnessesshould be in a position to name the individual accused persons for sustaining his conviction".183. Keeping in view the decisions of the Supreme Court and the facts and circumstances prevailingin the present case, this Court finds it appropriate to hold that a conviction may be sustained if anaccused person has been named and identified by at least two reliable witnesses who give a cogentand consistent account of the incident.Analysis of eye-witness testimonies184. In the light of the discussion above, this Court now proceeds to consider the testimonies ofthose PWs upon which the prosecution has formed its case.Kamala (PW-50)185. This witness is the wife of the deceased Tara Chand and the mother of deceased Suman. Thereis no doubt that she is an interested witness, being a close relation of the two deceased. However,her testimony cannot be discarded only for that reason. The legal position in relation to theappreciation of the evidence of a related witness is fairly well-settled. To recapitulate in brief, inDalip Singh v. State of Punjab AIR 1953 SC 364, the Supreme Court explained:"A witness is normally to be considered independent unless he or she springs fromsources which are likely to be tainted and that usually means unless the witness hascause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to implicate him falsely.Ordinarily, a close relative would be the last to screen the real culprit and falselyimplicate an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high and there is personalcause for enmity, that there is a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whoma witness has a grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be laid for such acriticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sureguarantee of truth. However, we are not attempting any sweeping generalisation.Each case must be judged on its own facts. Our observations are only made to combatwhat is so often put forward in cases before us as a general rule of prudence. There isno such general rule. Each case must be limited to and be governed by its own facts."186. In State of Bihar v. Basawan Singh AIR 1958 SC 500, the Constitution Bench of the SupremeCourt held:Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/65"The correct Rule is this: if any of the witnesses are accomplices who are particepscriminis in respect of the actual crime charged, their evidence must be treated as theevidence of accomplices is treated; if they are not accomplices but are partisan orinterested witnesses, who are concerned in the success of the trap, their evidencemust be tested in the same way as other interested evidence is tested by theapplication of diverse considerations which must vary from case to case, and in aproper case, the court may even look for independent corroboration before convictingthe accused person."187. In Jayabalan v. U.T. of Pondicherry (2010) 1 SCC 199, the Supreme Court held as under:"We are of the considered view that in cases where the court is called upon to dealwith the evidence of the interested witnesses, the approach of the court, whileappreciating the evidence of such witnesses must not be pedantic. The court must becautious in appreciating and accepting the evidence given by the interested witnessesbut the court must not be suspicious of such evidence. The primary endeavour of thecourt must be to look for consistency."188. Thus, the position that emerges from the aforementioned decisions is that their evidence is notto be looked upon with suspicion only because of their relationship with the deceased. Ordinarily, aclose relative would be the last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate an innocent person.Their evidence must be scrutinised carefully to ascertain if it has a ring of truth and must also beexamined for consistency. Therefore, the testimony of PW-50 would be considered reliable if itwithstands such scrutiny.189. One of the criticisms against PW-50 by the trial Court is that while in her previous statement tothe police, she named only 16 persons, during her deposition in Court, she has identified as many as81 persons as being present. It is further commented by the trial Court that her eye sight was weakand there was an undisputed report of the Medical Board that she could only recognize objects andpeople within a range of "6-8m without assistance".190. The Court has perused the rough site plan of village Mirchpur which shows that PW-50s housewas in fact adjacent to the house of the deceased Tara Chand. The trial Court has observed thataccording to this witness, she was hiding in the house of one Chander which was adjacent to thehouse of Mahender, which in turn was adjacent to the house of Tara Chand. In other words, all thesehouses were in a row next to each other. The trial Court has observed that the house of Chander wasalso damaged by rioting and fire and, therefore, "it is a mystery how this witness could have beenhiding in this house".191. This Court is of the view that this part of the testimony of the witness was not really shaken inher cross-examination. It was not justified for the trial Court to discredit her testimony on thisaspect. Further, if her house was in fact adjacent to the house of Tara Chand and she could recognizeobjects and people up to a distance of 6-8m without assistance, the trial Court could not haverejected her testimony by alluding to her weak eye sight and the possibility that her view was notKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/66unobstructed. These appear to be surmises and conjectures made by the trial Court which find nobasis even in the cross-examination of this witness.192. In her statement regarding the incident of 19 th April 2010, PW-50 mentioned that Karan Singh(DW-13) and Veerbhan were beaten up and that on the subsequent day, Gulaba (PW-48) was beatenup. The Court does not see any grave contradiction here. This witness was not saying that PW-48was beaten on the same day and time along with Karan Singh (DW-13) and Veerbhan. Hertestimony to the effect that Tara Chand and Suman were dragged out of the house, beaten up,doused in kerosene oil, and pushed back could not be rejected only because there was nocorroboration. This was a witness who was clearly present at the spot and had witnessed this ghastlyoccurrence herself.193. There is broad corroboration which emerges from the testimonies of the PWs of the fact thatwidespread rioting and arson was taking place in the village on the date of the incident. PW-50stands corroborated by Pradeep (PW-49) who clearly explains that the persons of the Jatcommunity surrounded the Balmiki basti from all four sides and attacked with jellies, gandasis andlathis. He further states that they also started burning the houses of the Balmikis whilesimultaneously indulging in stone pelting. He states:"They came towards my house and set my house on fire. My sister Suman who washandicapped from one leg was inside the house. My father was also inside the house.On hearing the noise, my father Tara Chand and sister Suman came out butassailants from the Jat Community, who were also accompanied by the ladies of theJat Community sprinkled petrol on them and set them on fire and pushed theminside the house. At that time, I was standing in the gali near the house and when Itried to save them stones were also thrown on me and I did not go forward to savethem fearing for my life.... My father who was still alive at the time rushed to thehouse of his neighour Diwan Singh son of Muthra and in a burnt condition while mysister burnt to death inside our house only."194. This corroborates the statement of PW-50 when she says:"My husband was beaten with dandas outside the house and kerosene was poured onhim and after setting him on fire, he was pushed inside the house by Pawan,Kulwinder, Hoshiyara, Rajender and SHO Kajal. Bharpai the wife of Pale and alongwith the wife of Pappu, whose name I do not know but I can recognize by facesprinkled kerosene on my daughter Suman, set her on fire and pushed her inside thehouse. They also looted our property."195. Therefore, it was plainly erroneous for the trial Court to state that no other witness supports theversion of PW-50. The trial Court has also wrongly observed that the testimony of PW-50contradicts the dying declaration made by Tara Chand and the medical evidence on the record. Aswill be discussed later, the medical evidence and the dying declaration in fact corroborate herversion completely.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/67196. The trial Court also seems to have formed the view that the fact that PW-50 "did not raise analarm or stop the assailants" throws up a doubt as to the veracity of her deposition. This, as hasalready been discussed, is deeply unfair to witness who was herself a victim of an attack by themembers of the Jat community who vastly outnumbered those from the Balmiki community. Thetrial Court has also noted that PW-50 had grossly exaggerated when she stated the strength of themob to be 400-500 persons when, in fact, the gali on which the house of Tara Chand was situatedcould hardly accommodate 100-150 persons. However, in the view of this Court, the point to benoted here is that a large mob had gathered there. Even a gathering of 100-150 persons was largeenough to overwhelm the victims. In such a scenario, to expect the persons under attack to interveneor even accompany the wounded to the hospital when fearful of being attacked is not reasonable.Further, merely because PW-50 herself did not sustain any injuries does not mean that the incidentdid not happen in the manner described by her.197. Most of the witnesses have stated that the police did not record everthing they said. The trialCourt has itself observed that the investigation was faulty. In the circumstances, to characterizePW-50 as untruthful and to reject her entire testimony was wholly uncalled for. Also, at the timewhen she first spoke to the police, PW-50 was clearly traumatized. She states that the police met heron the date of the incident and interrogated her, but she could not clearly recollect whether herstatement was recorded. She stated, "I was not in my proper senses at that time. I gave only 3-4names as stated hereinabove to the police but I can identify the assailants as they are all residents ofour village".198. It must also be noted at this juncture that the settled legal position as explained in severaldecisions of the Supreme Court such as that in Ramesh Harijan v. State of U.P. (2012) 5 SCC 777wherein it was opined:"....it is the duty of the court to separate grain from chaff. Falsity of particularmaterial witness or material particular would not ruin it from the beginning to end.The maxim falsus in uno falsus in omnibus has no application in India and thewitness cannot be branded as a liar. In case this maxim is applied in all the cases it isto be feared that administration of criminal justice would come to a dead stop.Witnesses just cannot help in giving embroidery to a story, however, true in the main.Therefore, it has to be appraised in each case as to what extent the evidence is worthyof credence, and merely because in some respects the court considers the same to beinsufficient or unworthy of reliance, it does not necessarily follow as a matter of lawthat it must be disregarded in all respects as well."199. Thus, the Court finds that the testimony of PW-50 is reliable. However, as a rule of prudence asregards consistency, the testimony of PW-50 is relied upon only to the extent of the 14 accused shenamed in the first instance to the police, viz. A-34, A-23 (deceased), A-22, A-38, A-93, A-1, A-2, A-4,A-3, A-31, A-12, A-30, A-33, and A-42 (deceased). Then again, her testimony qua the said 14 wouldbe relied upon only if corroborated by at least one other reliable eye witness.Amar Lal (CW-1)Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/68200. The testimony of PW-50 also receives corroboration from that of her son, Amar Lal (CW-1). Hetoo states that he had seen A-20 and Rajender A-34 leading the crowd. He states that they came tothe house were Tara Chand and Suman were present "inside the house due to fear". He furtherclearly states how A-20 and A-38 sprinkled oil from the cans which they were holding while A-34 setthe house on fire. When Tara Chand and Suman came out, they were caught by the persons standingoutside "and oil was sprinkled on them, after which they were pushed inside the house and the doorof the house was latched with the help of kundi". He was in front of the house of Chander Bhan andrequested the crowd not to do such acts "but nobody listened to us and during this process I was hitwith stones, one of which hit my foot and another on my back due to which reason I backed out".201. It cannot be doubted that CW-1, along with PW-50 and PW-49, was present at the spot and hadwitnessed all of these acts by the accused persons. CW-1 also states that the accused persons cameout and began to dance naked whilst saying, "ab inka kaam ho gaya inka matam karo". He hasspecifically named A-23, A-25, A-38, A-87, and one Vipin son of Ishwar (not chargesheeted) as theindividuals who had removed their clothes and danced in the gali in front of the house of TaraChand before going away. He then noticed that the roof of the house began to collapse. At that time,the door fell and deceased Tara Chand ran out and entered the house of Deewana son of Mathura.Suman, however, was in the rear portion of the house and could not be saved. He then states thatthe police came to the spot and he along with Ashok Kumar son of Maha Singh shifted Tara Chandto the Government Hospital, Hissar.202. He has stood firm even in the cross-examination and nothing emerged which would discredithis testimony. He also maintained that he had told the police what he had deposed in the trial Court.Consequently, this Court is of the view that this witness testimony is of a reliable nature and doesnot concur with the trial Courts finding that his testimony is only partly reliable.Pradeep (PW-49)203. This witness is also the son of deceased Tara Chand and has spoken of the Jat community mobsetting his house on fire and also that, when Tara Chand and Suman tried to flee, they were pushedback into the burning building after oil was sprinkled on them. He also speaks about the boys fromthe Jat community mob dancing naked on the street in front of the house. He further states that hisfather Tara Chand ran out of the burning house and into the house of Deewana son of Mathura. Inother words, this witness narration of the incident is wholly consistent with the depositions made bythe other family members of the deceased, viz. CW-1 and PW-50. His presence at the spot cannot bedenied and as such his testimony is reliable and consistent.204. The trial Court has invoked various lines of reasoning to discredit this witness. However, thisCourt cannot concur that his testimony lacks veracity due to the fact that he is not shown to haveassisted in the removal of the body of Suman or to have accompanied Tara Chand and Suman to thehospital. In this regard, he has stated that he was tending to his unconscious mother at the time.This explanation has, however, been rejected by the trial Court based on the conjectural reasoningthat "she too would have been removed to the hospital" if it was indeed the case that she had becomeunconscious.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/69205. The trial Court has also rejected his identification of 24 accused persons in Court on the groundthat he had admitted to making only one of the three statements under Section 161 Cr PC attributedto him. It was further held that although he is shown to have affixed his signatures on the seizurememos of the burnt motorcycle and ashes, this would only establish his presence at the spot at thetime of the exhibits being lifted and not when the incident actually took place.206. As per the view of this Court, his identification of the accused persons in the Court cannot bediscarded. It was not his fault that no TIP was conducted. The rejection of his identification of theaccused in the court for the first time could not have been discarded by the trial Court only on thatground. As already noticed, rejection of dock identification is not a foregone conclusion especially ina case like the present one where there are a large number of accused persons who were rioting aspart of a mob. The trial Court should also have considered the trauma being faced by the victimswho might have been unable to name all of those involved at the first time of asking. Thus, PW-49 isalso reliable and consistent in his narration of the incident dated 21 st April 2010. The trial Courthas erred in categorising this witness as only partly reliable.Rajbir (PW-10)207. PW-10 deposed that there was a dispute between the Jats and the Balmikis on 21st April 2010due to which the Jats "got together and came to the Balmiki mohalla and there was a marapiti". Hehas spoken of them coming armed with jellies, lathis and oil cans and that they pelted stones at theBalmikis. He has stated that he could recognise the "son of Pale whose name I do not know and oneboy whose name is Petla". Upon the accused persons being paraded before him, PW-10 correctlyidentified A-34 as the person whom he recognised as part of the mob on 21st April 2010.208. PW-10 has been held to be wholly unreliable for the reason that even though he did not nameanyone in his statement to the police, he has identified A-34 while deposing in Court. The trial Courtdisregarded his dock identification of A-34 on the basis that the latter was previously known to thewitness. However, this would not result in the entire testimony of this witness being termedunreliable. These witnesses were not in control of what the police recorded and many of themmaintained that the police did not record everything that they had stated.Sunita (PW-13)209. PW-13 has been disbelieved by the trial Court only because she had wrongly shown the MedicoLegal Report (MLR) of her ten year old son as her own. Her identity was also in doubt only becauseher mother-in-law showed the Court her election card which showed her name as Kanta. The factremained that in her deposition, it emerged that she had affixed her thumb impression on the MLRof her minor son. Also, she explained that she had other aliases which she was known by. Theelection card gave one of the aliases as Kanta. Therefore, this by itself was not a justification for thetrial Court to hold her entire testimony to be unreliable.Sandeep (PW-28)Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/70210. In terming PW-28 to be only a partly reliable witness, the trial Court had observed that histestimony could not be relied upon without reliable corroboration. This Court, having perused histestimony, finds that his narration of events stands corroborated by as many as 13 other witnesses.Thus, the testimony of this witness too is reliable and consistent.Sheela (PW-32)211. PW-32 was working as a safai karamchari at a school which was situated more or less within thevillage. She has stated that her duty time is from 8 am to 2 pm. She states that she came backtowards her home upon hearing that there was a commotion in the village. This is not thatsurprising and the school being not too far from the site of the incident, the trial Court was wrong interming her testimony to be unnatural. This Court is of the view that her deposition is reliable andtrustworthy.Santra (PW-30)212. PW-30 was a neighbour of Tara Chand and Suman and, therefore, her testimony wasimportant. She returned to the village in the afternoon of 21st April 2010 and locked herself insidethe house when she saw the rioting mob. She too identified assailants for the first time in the Court.She identified A-34 as the person who burnt the house. She also identified A-38 as the person whobroke into her house and broke her water tank. As has already been discussed, the mere fact thatPW-30 has identified A-34 and A-38 for the first time while testifying in Court would not make herentire testimony unreliable.213. PW-30 has been disbelieved also because the accused were not arrested at her instance and noTIP was conducted. This Court has already observed that the non- conduct of TIP would not vitiatethe testimony of a witness who is otherwise clear and consistent in their deposition. This Court,therefore, cannot concur with the trial Courts view that PW-30 is unreliable. She is a reliable witnesswhose testimony appears to be truthful.Rani (PW-33), Sanjay (PW-36), and Meena (PW-37)214. The trial Court has also wrongly disbelieved Rani (PW-33) only because she did not suffer anyinjuries. It is not necessary that every eye witness should suffer injuries for their depostions to bedeemed trustworthy. While it is true that in the statement recorded on 30th April 2010, she did notname any accused, she is a resident of the same village and could probably not muster the courageto speak to the police and name the accused in the first instance. While deposing in the Court, shecame from Ved Pal Tanwars farmhouse where she had sought refuge. While deposing in Court, sheidentified A-3, A-6, A-33, and A-34. While it is true that she stated that she was hiding in the gali,there must have been sufficient time for her to notice who the assailants were.215. The statement of her husband, Sanjay (PW-36), is also to the same effect. He too was deemed tobe unreliable by the trial Court and his testimony was held to be only admissible for corroborativepurposes. In his deposition in Court, he has identified A-34, A-23. A-52, A-46, A-64, A-1, A-47,Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/71A-26, A-11, A-93, A-21, A-77, A-78, A-66, A-42, A-80, A-94, A-13, A-38, and A-25. He had alsonamed A-58 in his deposition. An objection was raised by the defence that the statement made bythis witness to the police noted that he could not name any of the assailants. The following exchangeis noteworthy:"Court Question: Did you tell the police the names of the assailants duringinterrogation?Ans: I had told the police all the aforesaid names which I have now stated in court.Court Question: Did you tell the police during interrogation that you could identifyother persons involved in the incident whose name you did not know?Ans: Yes, I had told the police that I could identify them."216. It therefore appears that, as with other witnesses, the statement of PW-36 to the police was notrecorded properly even though he is stated to have named the assailants therein. In that view of thematter, this Court is inclined to believe this witness testimony as reliable and trustworthy.217. Meena Kumar (PW-37) also falls in the same category. He too denies telling the police that hecould not identify the assailants who were part of the mob. In fact, he states that he had informedthe police that he could identify some of them. While deposing in Court, he identified A-34, A-13,A-78, and A-11. The trial Court has erred in discarding the testimony of this witness merely becauseno TIP was conducted. As has already been discussed, this is not a strong enough ground to rejectthe testimony of a witness who is otherwise consistent and cogent in his narration of events. In thatview of the matter, this Court finds this witness to be reliable and trustworthy.Mahajan (PW-38), Sube Singh (PW-39), and Vijender (PW-40)218. PWs 38, 39, and 40 have been held to be only partly reliable by the trial Court. PW-38, who isan injured witness, named 42 assailants in his statement under Section 161 Cr PC which wasrecorded on 23rd April 2010. However, he was able to identify only some of them in Court. He alsomade a first time dock identification of A-79 and A-52. This does not make his testimony unreliable.On the contrary, it showed that of the several accused paraded before the Court, he pointed out onlysome of them specifically which actually makes his testimony credible. There was no justification forthe trial Court to hold that PW-38 was only partly reliable.219. PW-39 did not suffer injuries. In his statement under Section 161 Cr PC recorded on 21st April2010, he named 27 assailants. In Court, however, he identified only A-38, A-34, A-3, and A-92.Merely because he was shown to be wearing dark glasses at the time of the incident does not renderhis testimony improbable.220. PW-40 named 27 assailants in his statement under Section 161 Cr PC dated 21st April 2010. InCourt, he could identify A-34, A-94, A-52, A-21, A-13, A-79, A-32, A-20, and A-33. Merely becauseKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/72he has not received injuries, it could not have been held that his presence at the scene was notestablished. Also, because he identified A-21, A-79, and A-52 for the first time in the trial Court, thiswould not render his testimony to be unreliable. It appears that he is a natural witness who waspresent at the scene of occurrence.Dhoop Singh (PW-29)221. This witness had received grievous injuries during the incident of 21st April 2010. He hasdeposed that on that morning, "persons from the Jat community created a rolla/jhagra near theBalmiki mohalla". He then states that more than 400 persons belonging to the Jat community cameto the Balmiki basti with buggies filled with stones, bricks, and oil cans. He states that he was at hisshop when the Jat community mob surrounded the Balmiki basti and started burning the houses ofthe Balmiki community.222. Upon hearing a commotion outside his shop he came out to see A-20, A-77, A-52, and A-94breaking and entering into his house. He then states that A-20 gave a lathi blow to his left armwhich resulted in a fracture. A-77 is stated to have given a danda blow to his left leg. He then statesthat they proceeded to break the water tank and set fire to his four shops and all the articles therein.The fire then spread to his house which was completely burnt. He goes on to state that at around 11am, a government vehicle removed him along with two others to the hospital where he was treatedfor his injuries.223. The trial Court has rightly held this witness testimony to be wholly reliable and this Courtconcurs with that finding.Vicky (PW-42)224. There has been an extensive discussion by the trial Court of the deposition of PW-42. It isstrange that the trial Court doubts his testimony only because he was leading the agitation for justicein this case. In the Court, he identified several assailants. His father Dhoop Singh (PW-29) sufferedgrievous injuries. Since all the Balmikies were being attacked, many of them could not accompanythe other injured persons to the hospital. That was true of PW-42 as well. Only because he did notaccompany his injured father to the hospital would not mean that PW-42 was not at all present.225. The fact that PW-29 did not mention the presence of PW-42 should not come as a surprise. Inthe commotion as a result of the rioting, where more than 150 Jat community members hadsurrounded the Balmiki basti, it is possible that PW-29 did not notice the presence of his son,PW-42. On the contrary, PW-42 has given extensive details which support the prosecution caseconsiderably. The relevant portion of his testimony worth reproducing is as under:"....in the morning of 21.04.2010 at about 8 AM Rajender Son of Pale was passingthrough the main gali in his boogie while he was going to his house. He had someverbal altercation with some boys of the balmiki community but I was not there. Heran away from that place raising an alarm"choorya ne mardiya, choorya ne marKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/73diya".He went to the main Chaupal of the jat community andcollected large numberof boys. From there all these boys came towards our (balmiki) houses armed withdandas, gandases, stones and when they came towards the houses there was analtercation between them and us(apas mein jhagra hua)and after some timetheseboys ran back towards the houses belonging to persons from the jat community.Gulaba, Chowkidar was coming from the gali and was crossing from the gali ofRajender Son of Pale. There Gulaba was stopped byRajender Son of Pale andRishiSon of Satbirand beaten with dandas. Gulaba came towards our houses and startedcrying. He was injured on his knees and legs as he wasbeaten with dandas. Thereafterthese boys from the jat community called more persons and boys belonging from jatcommunity from out side areas (out side the village). About 1000-1500 persons fromthe jat community gathered at the jat choppal and from there they came to ourbalmiki basti. They were armed with lathies, gandasi, stones,oil canes and petrol.While these boys were still coming from choppal side, some persons from the villagefrom the jat community came to us and told us to gathered at our choppal for asettlement. While we were at choppal these jat boys who were coming from thechoppal in the meanwhile started burning houses of persons from the balmikicommunity. they started pelting stones on us while we were still standing in the maingali. they surrounded our basti from all the four sides. They burnt the house of TaraChand, Sube Singh, Chander Singh, my own house, the house of Gulaba and all histhree sons. They burnt about 20-25 houses. We were surrounded from all the foursides and it became difficult for us to save our lives. We did not know whether to saveourselves, or our childrenor what to do. My father Dhoop Singh was unwell as he wassuffering from respiratory problem. He was alone at our house and my mother andtwo nephews were also at home. When I saw what was happening I ran back to myhouse apprehending danger to the lives of my family members. At that time theseboys were in the process of setting the house of Chander on fire which is on thecorner of the main gali. I told my father to move in view of the prevailingcircumstances but since his condition was serious he could not move. In order to savemy other family members my mother and two nephews escaped from the back side ofthe house whereas I remained in the house with my ailing father who could not move.We are having four shops and I had shut the main gates but there boys came thereand while I and my father were hiding inside the house behind the shops, I saw thatthe gates of our shops were broken and a large numberof boys jumped inside andstarted setting the shops on fire. I could see Ramphal Son of Prithvi, Sanjay Son ofDaya Nand, Pardeep Son of Jaiveer, Sonu Son of Wakil, Pardeep Son of Suresh,Satyawan Son of Rajender, Rajpal Son of Sheo Chand, Bobbal Son of Tek Ramwhowere sprinkling oil on the walls of our shop and setting it on fire along with manyother boys whose name he does not remember but can tell after refreshing hismemory and also after seeing their faces. He has alsostated that many of these boyshave not been apprehended till date. When these boys jumped and came inside myfather pleaded to them with folded hands and asked them what was our fault. On thisRamphal hit my father with a lathi on his arm and Sanjay Son of Daya Nand hit myfather with a lathi on his legs. The arm of my father was fractured and he receivedKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/74injuries. Sanjay then shouted to the others "vickey ko dundo kare hai". I was hidinginside the house. My father had fallen down and while these boys were still searchingfor me he shouted to me from outside to run away as these boys would otherwise killme. On getting an opportunity I escaped by jumping from the terrace. Two or three ofthese boys who sawed me and followed me but I managed to escape. While my housewas set on fire and was burning I saw 2-3 police persons watching the same. Theseboys were also exhorting and shouting "chura ne aag lage do, deda ne aag lago de".They burnt our houses and many of these boys were dancing naked on the streetswhich I sawed when I climbed on the roof in order to save myself. Out of them I couldrecognize Sumeet Son of Satyawan, Kulwinder Son of Ram Mehar. When the policecame at about 1-1.30 pm while the houses were still on fire and I had come back tomy house to search for my father, I found Sanjay Son of Ammar Lal on the back sideof my house to search for my father, I found Sanjay Son of Amar Lal on the back sideof my house standing with a danda in his hand shouting "koi chura marya ya nahi".My uncle Jaiveer had entered the house from the back side and saved my father andwhen I came back to my house after the police had come I found that my father hadbeen removed to my grandfather's house by my uncle Jaiveer. Ambulance had cometo the village and my father Dhoop Singh was removed to the hospital along withTara and his daughter Suman who were burnt to death."226. PW-42 was subjected to extensive cross-examination, but nothing which would aid the defenceemerged. He maintained in his cross-examination as under:".... I had told the police that in the morning of 21.4.2010 at about 8 AM RajenderSon of Pale was passing through the main gali in his boogie while he was going to hishouse when he had some verbal altercation with some boys of the balmikicommunity. I also told the police that Rajender ran from that place raising alarm"churya ne mar diya, churya ne mar diya" and thereafter he went to the main choppalof the jat community and collected large number of boys from where all these boyscame towards our (balmikies) houses armed with dandas, gandas, stones and whenthey came to our houses there was a quarrel between them and us.I also told thepolice that after some time all these boys ran away back towards the housesbelonging to the jat community and Gulaba, Chowkidar was coming from the gali andwas crossing from the gali of Rajender Son of Pale where Gulaba was stopped byRajender Son of Pale and Rishi Son of Satbir and beaten with dandas.I also told thepolice that Gulaba came towards our houses and sttarted crying and he was injuredon his knees and legs as he has been beaten with dandas and thereafter these boysfrom the jat community called more persons and boys belonging from the jatcommunity from out side areas (out side the village) and about 1000- 1500 personsfrom the jat community gathered at the jat choppal and from there they came to ourbalmiki basti..."227. PW-42 was able to correctly identify several of the assailants in the trial Court. He identifiedA-3 as the person indulging in the stone pelting; A-90 as the one who had broken the door of theKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/75house and set it on fire; A-38 as an assailant indulging in quarrelling and stone pelting; A-23 as theone who hit his father Gulaba (PW-48) with a lathi; A-34 as the assailant accompanying A-23; andA-20 as one of those who were setting the houses on fire. The trial Court wrongly relied on thestatement which he gave before the CoI to the effect that his house was not situated next to thosewhich were burnt. However, this would not mean that he did not witness the burning of the houses.There was sufficient independent corroboration in terms of photographs, videograph as well as thetestimonies of other witnesses. In the considered view of the Court, PW-42 is in fact a reliablewitness and should have been held to be as such by the trial Court.Dilbagh (PW-43)228. Although this witness was held to be only partly reliable, this Court is of the view that he is infact a wholly reliable witness. Merely because he himself did not suffer injuries did not mean that hewas not present at the scene of occurrence. In his cross-examination, he was very categorical andstated as under:"On 21.04.2010 the stone pelting continued for about one and a half hours. It iscorrect that the stone pelting was between Jats and the Balmikis. Vol. the Jats hadstarted pelting the stones first. It is wrong to suggest that stone pelting resultedbecause the boys belonging to the balmiki community had first caused beating toRajender Son of Pale and Karampal Son of Satbir who were coming from their fieldsin the morning on their boogie through the main gali. It is wrong to suggest that thebeating had been given because Rajender could not distribute milk in the villagewhich milk he used toget from Lakshay Dairy."Sanjay (PW-44)229. He had named a number of accused in his statement under Section 161 Cr PC which was givenon 21st April 2010. However, in the trial Court, he only identified A-34, A-23, A-38, A-39, A-13,A-20, A-94, and A-66. He spoke about his father Gulaba (PW-48) receiving injuries as a result ofdanda beatings. As far as this witness is concerned, he gave several details in hisexamination-in-chief. Despite the fact that a few more details were elicited by the SPP regardingnames of the persons present, PW-44 still maintained that he was an eye witness himself and that hecould identify many of the boys by face if shown to him. Merely because he did not accompanyPW-48 to the hospital did not mean that he was not present at the spot. The trial Court erred inholding that his conduct was not natural and probable.230. The comment that "he has changed his stance before various Courts" is contrary to the trialCourts own conclusion that his statement before the CoI could not have been used against himduring his deposition in the trial Court. In the considered view of the Court, the characterisation bythe trial Court of PW-44 as only partly reliable was not justified and he should not have beencharacterised as such.Manoj (PW-45)Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/76231. He named 34 assailants in the statement given to the police by him on 21st April 2010. In hissubsequent statement on 27th June 2010, he named A-27, A- 78 and A-90. While deposing in Court,he identified A-69, A-50, A-57, A-40, A- 29, A-2, A-65, A-79, A-14, A-22, A-77, A-52, A-66, A-23, andA-38. They all belonged to the same village and therefore, his identification of these accused in theCourt could not have been held to be unreliable. The rejection of his testimony on this aspect onlybecause there were no photographs showing his presence is suspicious since the photographs weretaken long after the conclusion of the event. There is sufficient corroboration of his evidence whichmakes his testimony reliable and consistent.232. In his cross-examination also, PW-45 was consistent. He pointed that the police officials cameto the village much later only after a complaint was given. He confirmed that PW-48 was injuredand was treated subsequently for the same. He has withstood the cross-examination by the defence.He was a truthful witness who maintained that he did not receive injuries but got compensation forthe damage to his property. The stone pelting, arson, and looting, according to him, continued till 1pm. His initial statement was recorded on 21 st April 2010 itself. The leading questions put by theprosecutor only helped PW-45 to identify the burnt motorcycle belonging to Sunil son of Brij Bhan,the brother-in-law of PW-45. There is nothing in the cross-examination of PW-45 that persuades theCourt to disbelieve this witness. Thus, he should have been held to be a reliable witness whosetestimony was natural and trustworthy.Satyawan (PW-47) and Gulaba (PW-48)233. As regards PW-47, only because he identified A-34, A-20, and A-94 for the first time in the trialCourt, whereas he had named two assailants in his previous statement, did not make him anunreliable witness.234. PW-48 was an injured witness. He had received three simple injuries. The trial Court itself heldthat his presence at the time of the incident could not be doubted. He cannot be said to be anunreliable witness as regards the incident of rioting. He noticed women with oil cans in preparationfor the riot that was to follow and his testimony is vital in throwing light on the conspiratorialelement of the incident of 21st December 2010. PW-48 had named 43 persons in his previousstatement to the police and has identified only a few of them while deposing in the trial.Nevertheless, this is not a witness who should have been held as only partly reliable.235. Thus, although the trial Court has held all but two of the 23 witnesses who supported the caseof the prosecution to be wholly unreliable or only partly reliable, this Court is of the view that thesewitnesses have in fact deposed consistently and cogently and nothing material emerges from theirtestimonies which would raise doubts as to their veracity. The prosecution, through the testimoniesof these witnesses, has been successful in its endeavour to establish several aspects of the incident of21st April 2010.Dying declarations of Tara ChandKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/77236. The dying declarations of the deceased Tara Chand are further important pieces of evidence forthe prosecution. It must be recalled that Tara Chand was removed from the spot first and admittedto the General Hospital, Hissar by SI Bani Singh (PW-64) on the instructions DSP Abhey Singh(PW-66). The depositions of PWs 64 and 66 clearly bear out these facts. He was rushed to the saidhospital at around 2:30 pm on 21st April 2010 as shown by the bed-head ticket (Ex.PW-52/B). Hehad suffered deep burns all over the body except the axillary region and the inguinopubic region. Anapplication was moved before the Medical Officer (MO) by PW-64 to seek his opinion regarding thefitness of the patient to make a statement. The said application is Ex.PW-64/B.237. Dr. Dinesh Kumar (PW-68) certified at 3.50 pm that Tara Chand was fit to make a statement.PW-64 then recorded the dying declaration which bears the right thumb impression (RTI) of TaraChand and was in fact countersigned by PW-68 as well as Amar Lal (CW-1). This is Ex.PW-64/C.238. Dr. Dinesh Kumar (PW-68) was cross-examined at length, but nothing useful could be elicitedby the defence to discredit his testimony. He denied the suggestion put to him in cross-examinationthat "Tara Chand had never regained consciousness so as to be able to make the statement".239. Mr. Hariharan, learned Senior Counsel, submitted that no blood pressure or pulse could berecorded and in that situation, Tara Chand could simply not have made a dying declaration. Thissuggestion was put to PW-68 who denied it. He categorically stated that "it is wrong to suggest thatonce BP and Pulse are not recordable, patient cannot be conscious and fit to make a statement. Vol.Consciousness is different from the recording of BP and Pulse". Therefore, the attempt by theaccused to show that the dying declaration could not have been recorded had failed and this wassomehow overlooked by the trial Court.240. The first dying declaration made by Tara Chand before PW-64 clearly points out that at around12 noon, Tara Chand and Suman were in the house. He mentions that A-34 was present along with20 others. He then states that "Kamre mein weh meri ladki Suman ba umar 18 varsh ko aag laga karkamre ko bahar se kunda laga ke Jati sukar galian de rahe the. Darwaja jalaya". Tara Chandmentioned that after the house was burnt and he emerged from it, he was attacked by lathis andthen he rushed to Diwan Singhs house whereas Suman could not leave the house. His other housewas also burnt. He then mentions Amar Lal (CW-1) and his own brother-in-law Ashok Kumar takinghim to the hospital in the police gypsy. He then mentions that the names of the other personsinvolved in the attack on his person would be disclosed by Amar Lal (CW-1) whereas he couldrecognize them if they were produced before him.241. There is nothing in the first dying declaration of Tara Chand which is not consistent with whathas been spoken by PWs 49 and 50 and CW-1. His post- mortem report indicates that he hadsuffered extensive burns and, therefore, again the medical evidence cannot be said to havecontradicted the testimonies of PWs 49 and 50 and CW-1.242. The second dying declaration of Tara Chand was recorded by the Duty Magistrate. This waspursuant to an application moved before Harish Goel (PW-55) by PW-64. PW-55 reached theGeneral Hospital at 5:30 pm. PW-68 gave him a certificate regarding fitness of the injured and hisKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/78ability to give a statement. Then PW-55 again recorded the statement of Tara Chand as under:"Q: Apka naam kya hai?Ans.: Tara Chand.Q: Apko Kya hua hai?Ans.: Mai apne ghar mei tha. Mera ghar jato ne phook diya. Aag Rajender ne lagaithi. Rajender ke bap ka naam Pali hai.Q: Apko kuch aur kehna hai?Ans.: Nahi."243. Therefore, on two occasions, A-34 was clearly mentioned and even his fathers name was clearlymentioned. How these dying declarations should simply be rejected, as suggested by learned SeniorCounsel Mr. Hariharan, is not understood. There was no need for PW-55, who was a JudicialMagistrate, First Class, to make any false statement whatsoever. His entire testimony in this regardrequires reproduction as under:"On 21.04.2010 IO ESI Bani Singh had moved an application before me for gettingthe statement of Tara Chand recorded. The application of ESI Bani Singh is Ex. PW55/A which was recieved in the Court at about 5:15 pm and bears my signatures atpoint A. I proceeded towards general hospital, Hissar. I reached at general hospital,Hissar at 5:50 pm and there Dr. Dinesh Kumar Prajapat, Medical Officer met me andtold me that patient Tara Chand was lying at bed no. 6 of the emergency ward.Thereafter I proceeded towards bed no. 6 Dr. Dinesh Kumar Prajapat has givencertificate regarding fitness of Tara Chand to make his statement. Thereafter Irecorded the statement of Tara Chand whcih is Ex. PW 55/B which bears mysignatures at point A. The fitness certificate of Dr. Dinesh Kumar Prajapat in respectof the patient Tara Chand which he had given before I proceeded to record hisstatement is present at point Mark B and the certificate of fitness given by him after Icompleted the recording of Tara Chand is present at point Mark C. Thereafter I mademy endorsement and gave my certificate which I duly identity. The said certificate isEx. PW 55/C bearing my signatures at point A."244. PW-55 too was subjected to extensive cross-examination, but nothing of any assistance to thedefence came of it. The only noteworthy statement was that the dying declaration was not sealed on21st April 2010 but on 23rd April 2010.245. Even the testimony of PW-64 shows that Tara Chand and Suman were burnt and they weretaken in a burnt condition accompanied by CW-1 and Ashok Kumar to the hospital. PW-64 hasclearly spoken about PW-68 opining about the fitness of Tara Chand to make a statement. PW-64Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/79has also spoken about recording of the statement of Tara Chand at the first instance and then goingagain before PW-55 with an application and PW-55 coming to the hospital to record Tara Chand'sstatement thereafter. PW-64 specifically denied the suggestions that Tara Chand was not fit to makea statement and that he recorded Tara Chands statement of his own accord and fabricated theendorsement from the doctor.246. PW-66 also confirms that it is he who gave directions to PW-64 to take Tara Chand to theGeneral Hospital and then get his statement recorded. The time of PW-55 recording the statementof Tara Chand is given by PW-68 as about 5:15 to 5:30 pm and he clearly stated that, "at that time,the patient was conscious".247. In Shama v. State of Haryana (2017) 11 SCC 535, the Supreme Court observed:"In the absence of any kind of infirmity and/or suspicious circumstances surroundingexecution of the dying declaration, once it is proved in evidence in accordance withlaw, it can be relied on for convicting the accused, even in the absence ofcorroborative evidence, but with the rule of prudence that this should be done so withextreme care and caution."248. Furthermore, in Gokal v. State (decision dated 12th May 2009 in Crl.A.228 of 2001) wherein itwas observed as under:"The fact that the deceased was suffering from severe burn injuries does notnecessarily lead to a conclusion that she was not in a position to inform the doctorabout the said incident, particularly in the light of the deposition of the doctor whohad conducted the post-mortem of the deceased that a patient who has sustained98% burn injuries can remain conscious for sometime after sustaining the injuries."249. It cannot be said in the present case that the dying declaration is uncorroborated. As hasalready been demonstrated, there is sufficient evidence in the form of the depositions of CW-1 andPWs 49 and 50 as well as those of PWs 55, 64 and 68 that fully corroborate the dying declaration ofTara Chand, which is a substantive piece of evidence which can be relied upon to convict the accusedpersons.Analysis of defence witnesses250. As far as the defence evidence is concerned, there were as many as 44 defence witnessesexamined of which DWs 6 to 9, 11 to 17, 18 to 25, 28, 36, 37, 40, and 41 were public witnesses. KaranSingh (DW-13), who was himself injured in the incident of 19th April 2010, came to be examined asa defence witness. Veerbhan had already deposed against the prosecution and turned hostile in thetrial arising out of the FIR registered for the incident of 19 th April 2010. Therefore, both KaranSingh (DW-13) and Veerbhan were understandably dropped by the prosecution and one of them wasthereafter examined as a defence witness. However, there were several other witnesses who couldsufficiently prove the incidents that occurred on 19th April 2010 as well as on 21st April 2010.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/80Murder or culpable homicide?251. The trial Court, in its judgment dated 24 th September 2017, has chosen to convict only three ofthe 97 accused persons for the killings of Tara Chand and Suman, viz. A-20, A-34, and A-38. It hasalso chosen to only convict the said three accused for the offence under Section 304(II)/120B IPCeven though they were charged with having committed murder punishable under Section 302/120BIPC. The trial Courts decision to convict these three accused persons under the lesser offence hasbeen challenged in the appeals preferred by the State and the complainants along with challenges tothe acquittals of the other accused persons in this case. According to the State, A-3, A-25, A-13,A-27, and A-64 ought to have also been convicted under Section 302/120B IPC and Section 3(2)(iv)and (v) POA Act.252. In this context, it requires to be noticed first that according to the trial Court, this was a case ofculpable homicide not amounting to murder as the evidence of the prosecution did not prove thatthe accused persons intended to commit the murder of Tara Chand and his daughter Suman. It hasalready been noticed that PWs 49 and 50, the son and wife of Tara Chand, and CW-1 Amar Lal, theother son of Tara Chand, have all consistently spoken about Tara Chand and Suman being beaten,doused with oil, set afire and then pushed into the house.253. The trial Court erred in holding that the dying declaration of Tara Chand did not support thetestimonies of PWs 49 and 50 and CW-1. It has already been noticed that Tara Chand specificallynamed A-34 in both his dying declarations and also added that A-34 was not alone but wasaccompanied by others. He stated that CW-1 would give the names of the other persons. For thereasons already explained, this Court has held that the two dying declarations of the deceased TaraChand are reliable and have been recorded in the manner required by law. Further, these threewitnesses have specifically named those who set fire to Tara Chand and Suman.254. As far as PW-49 is concerned, he named A-34, A-2, A-38, Vipin son of Joginder, A-18, Vikasson of Suresh, A-39, A-13, A-3, A-23, A-25, A-20, Rinku son of Dayanand, A-64, Sumeet son ofDayanand, A-27, A-40, and A-87 when deposing in the trial. He was unable to be shaken in thecross-examination. He also mentioned about the wife of Pale, the wife of Pappu, and the wife ofSatyawan being involved in the incident.255. Turning to PW-50, she is clear that Tara Chand was set on fire and pushed inside the house byA-2, A-34, A-31, A-38, and A-37. She has also named A-1, A-3, and Balwan son of Dharambir asbeing part of the mob that attacked her home. Therefore, the involvement of A-34, A-38, and A-2has been spoken to by both PWs 49 and 50. Amar Lal (CW-1) has also specifically named A-20 andA-34 as leading the crowd and also that A-38 and A-20 were sprinkling oil from the cans. The rolesof A-34 and A-38 are, therefore, confirmed by all three of these witnesses. A-20 has been named byCW-1 and PW-49.256. The trial Court has employed the strange reasoning that, had the doors been locked as spokento by the witnesses, Tara Chand would not have been able to run to the house of his neighbour.What the trial Court has missed is the deposition of PW-49 wherein it is stated that the doorKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/81collapsed with the house having been burned down and only thereafter, did Tara Chand run to thehouse of his neighbour. This is clearly spoken to by CW-1 himself when he states that "when thesepersons went away I noticed that the roof of our house started collapsing. The door of our house alsocollapsed and my father who was in the front portion of the house ran out and entered the house ofDeewana son of Mathura".257. The retrieval of Sumans body was done by breaking through the roof of her room. It is possiblethat the door was locked from inside by Suman due to the fear of the ongoing riot. The fact remainsthat no one among the assailants was in doubt that Tara Chand and Suman were in the house whenthey set the house on fire. The finding of the trial Court that it was never the intention of the Jatcommunity mob to commit murder is plainly adverse.258. Just because Sube Singh (PW-39) was spared during the attack by a few of the assailants didnot mean that the mob did not intend to murder Tara Chand and his daughter Suman. The questionwas both of knowledge and intention. The argument put forth that "if the intention was to kill, theaccused would have come armed with dangerous weapons" is again an unacceptable finding. Theycame armed in large numbers, set fire to the properties of the Balmikis by using oil cannisters andthen sprinkling oil on both Tara Chand and Suman and setting them on fire.259. On the aspect of the FSL report not showing the presence of hydrocarbons, the Court wouldlike to refer to the decision if this Court in Pritam Singh v. State (decision dated 27th March 2009 bya Division Bench of this Court in Crl.A.405/2001), it was opined:"29. That kerosene oil was not detected on the clothes of the deceased by the expert atthe Forensic Science Laboratory is neither here nor there.30. It makes no difference, for the reason, where quantity of oil poured is less,presumably, the whole of it would be consumed by the fire and no residual traces ofkerosene oil would be noted."260. Consequently, the trial Court was clearly in error in holding that the failure of the prosecutionto prove the presence of hydrocarbons of petroleum on the clothes of the deceased Suman or thatthe post mortem report showing that the deceased had expired due to ordinary burns and not oilburns led to the conclusion that the accused persons did not intend to commit the murder of TaraChand and Suman.261. The trial Court also erred in holding that there was no evidence to show that "the deceased waspushed into the burning house and doors locked from outside". The testimonies of PW-49 and CW-1which are corroborated by PW-50 indicate the contrary. The photographs showed that the house ofTara Chand and the neighbouring house were burnt. The motorcycle of PW-49 was also completelyburnt and was also identified by him.262. On the one hand, the trial Court notices that none of the exceptions to Section 300 IPC areattracted since the provocation could not be said to have been grave and sudden and yet the trialKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/82Court proceeded to hold that the offence that led to the death of the two deceased was culpablehomicide not amounting to murder within the scope of Section 304(II) IPC. In the present case, theaccused set fire to the house of Tara Chand knowing very well that it was the house of a personbelonging to the Balmiki community and further, that he and his daughter were both inside thehouse. In the opinion of this Court, the witnesses testimonies have more than adequately proved thecommission of the offence under Section 302 IPC and there was no occasion at all for the trial Courtto convert the offence into one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.263. The trial Court adopted the specious reasoning that the stone pelting occurred in the heat ofpassion as a rumour had spread in the village on the morning of 21st April 2010 of A-34 having beenkilled by the boys of the Balmiki community. The trial Court lost sight of the sequence of eventswhere the incident involving A-34 on the main gali had occurred at around 8 am whereas the stonepelting and setting of fire of the Balmiki properties happened between 11 am and 12 noon. There wasmore than sufficient time for the Jat community members to assemble and then attack the Balmikihouses, and it couldnt have been said to have occurred in the heat of passion or due to a grave andsudden provocation.264. The trial Court also indulged in conjectures and surmises by stating that stacks of cow dungcakes and dry sticks were kept at various places in the Balmiki basti which were set afire. What ismore pertinent, however, is who set those stacks on fire. This was not a case of a fire spreadingquickly as a result of any accidental fire catching on to the cow dung cakes or other flammablematerials which were just lying around. This was an act of deliberate targeting of the Balmiki housesby the Jat community mob and setting them on fire in a pre- planned and carefully orchestratedmanner. The entire evidence, if read carefully, more than adequately demonstrates that there was alarge scale conspiracy hatched by members of the Jat community to teach the Balmikis a lesson andpursuant to that conspiracy, houses of the Balmiki community were set on fire.265. The evidence unmistakably shows that Tara Chand and his daughter Suman were set on fireand pushed inside the house in that condition in the full knowledge that they were Balmikis. Thedying declaration of Tara Chand more than adequately establishes the role of not only A-34 but alsothat of his associates who were identified by those present i.e. PW-49, PW-50 and CW-1.Consequently, the Court holds that the killing of Tara Chand and Suman was murder punishableunder Section 302 IPC. The judgment of the trial court that it was culpable homicide punishableunder Section 304 (II) IPC is hereby set aside.Accused persons convicted by the trial Court266. The Court shall first deal with the appeals of three convicted accused, i.e. A-34, A-38, and A-20,who were found guilty by the trial Court of having committed the offences punishable under Section147 IPC and Sections 323/427/436/304(II) all read with Section 149 IPC. They were also convictedfor the offence punishable under Section 3(2)(iv) POA Act. While A-38 has challenged his convictionby way of Crl.A.129/2012, A-20 and A-34 have approached this Court in appeal against theirconvictions in Crl.A.226/2012. They have also appealed against the sentences awarded to them ashas been set out hereinbefore. It is pertinent to note that these accused have been sentenced underKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/83Section 3(2)(v) POA Act which would supercede the sentences to be awarded under Sections 304(II)and 436 IPC.A-34: Rajender son of Pale 267.1 Mr. Hariharan, learned Senior Counsel, has appeared for A-34 inCrl.A.226/2012. PWs 20, 23, 25, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, and 42 to 50 and CW-1 have allidentified him in the trial. Of these witnesses, PWs 37, 38, 39, 40, 45, 46, 49, and 50 as well as CW-1have all attributed guilt to A-34 for the burning of the house of Tara Chand which resulted in thedeath of his daughter Suman and himself. Further, PWs 42, 43, 44, and 48 have all spoken of hisinvolvement in the physical assault on Gulaba (PW-48). Meanwhile, PWs 30, 32, and 36 have madeallegations against him of indulging in arson during the rioting.267.2 Mr. Hariharan has firstly sought to submit that A-34 was not even present in the village at thetime of the rioting as he had been taken to the hospital due to the injuries suffered by him in thealtercation which took place on the main gali on the morning of 21st April 2010. In this context, hehas placed reliance on the evidence of DWs 18, 39, and 42.267.3 Suman (DW-18) has stated that she saw A-34 in the General Hospital in Jind where she wasworking at some point in time between 11:30 to 11:45 am on the day of the incident. She wasinformed by him that he had sustained some injuries as there was a quarrel in the village with someBalmiki boys who had inflicted injuries upon him and A-36, who was apparently present at thehospital at the time as well. However, no MLC pertaining to A-34 was brought on the record.267.4 Dipender Singh (DW-39) has been examined in order to prove the attendance register whichestablished the presence of DW-18 at the hospital at the relevant time. However, with the MLC ofA-34 not being produced, the mere presence of DW-18 at the hospital does not help the case of theaccused at all.267.5 The defence has then sought to rely on the testimony of Deepak Kumar (DW-42), who wasworking as the Nodal Officer for Idea Cellular, Haryana. He had brought the record pertaining to themobile number of A-34. The record revealed that the mobile number used by A-34 ending 8500showed that at 12:28 pm, the phone was located at village Rajpura and thereafter, at Jind from 12:41pm onwards. Up until 12:28 pm, the records actually showed that A-34 was present at villageMirchpur. Therefore, far from establishing his plea of alibi, these records actually show that A-34was present in the village at the relevant time.267.6 Mr. Hariharan then sought to critically appraise the dying declaration of the deceased TaraChand to show that where his pulse and blood pressure were not even recordable, it is highlyimprobable that any dying declaration could have been recorded. This has already been discussedhereinbefore at length and it would suffice to say that the evidence of PW-68 more than adequatelyproves that Tara Chand was conscious and in a position to give a statement notwithstanding that hispulse and blood pressure could not be recorded. Further, PW-55 who actually recorded the dyingdeclaration as the JMFC could not be shaken in his cross examination. There was absolutely no needfor this official to make any false deposition in order to unnecessarily implicate the accused.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/84267.7 Mr. Hariharan has also questioned the very applicability of the POA Act by trying to show thatthe fact that the Balmikis were a Scheduled Caste had not been proved. In the first place, as alreadypointed out, this was never earlier contended by the accused, even in the trial Court. As far as theState of Haryana is concerned, Balmiki @ Chura caste is one of those listed as a Scheduled Caste.The Court can well take judicial notice of this fact but this was never in issue before the trial Court.Even if it was raised as a contention by the accused at that stage, there would have been no difficultyat all for the prosecution to satisfy the trial Court that the victims belonged to a Scheduled Caste.267.8 As far as the reliance on Asharfi v. State of U.P. (supra) is concerned, it only clarifies that afterthe amendment which took effect from 26th January 2016, the mere knowledge that the victimbelongs to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe is sufficient to attract the offence punishable underSection 3(2)(v) POA Act. In the present case, the victims were attacked by the Jat community whowere fully aware that the victims belonged to the Balmiki community. In fact, they intended to do soas it was revenge for the purported insult suffered by the Jat community as a result of the incidentsof 19th and 21st April 2010. Therefore, in no way does this decision help the case of the accused atall.267.9 The same holds true for the decision in Dinesh @ Buddha v. State of Rajasthan (supra) whichstates that the sine qua non for application of Section 3(2)(v) POA Act is that an offence must havebeen committed against a person who belongs to a Scheduled Caste. In the present case, in theevidence of the District Welfare Officer, Dalip Singh (DW-38), it stands proved that compensationwas disbursed to the victim families only because they belonged to a Scheduled Caste and this wasdone under the POA Act. It is, therefore, more than adequately proved that the victims belonged to aScheduled Caste.267.10 Reliance was placed on the decision in Kartik Ram v. State of M.P. 2015 CriLJ 2958(SJ-Chattisgarh) to urge that the investigation should have been done by a police officer not belowthe rank of DSP. In the present case, investigation has been conducted by officers of the rank ofDSP. All arrests have been proved as having been effected by DSP Abhay Singh (PW-66) and DSPTula Ram (PW-67). The same holds good for the decision in Masumsha Hasanasha Musalman v.State of Maharashtra (supra). The decsision in State of A.P. v. Viswanadula Chetti Babu (supra) isalso distinguishable on facts and therefore, not helpful to the case of A-34.267.11 There are numerous eye witnesses who have established the presence of A-34 at the time ofthe incident. He has been identified by PWs 10, 13, 25, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, and45-50 and by CW-1. Therefore, there is more than sufficient evidence to establish the presence ofA-34 in the village at the relevant time on the fateful day. This is irrespective of the fact that he wasthe person who was involved in the altercation with boys from the Balmiki community on themorning of 21st April 2010.267.12 In this context, it must be noticed that a desperate attempt has been made by the defence toexamine members of the Balmiki community themselves as DWs to show that it was the Balmikicommunity boys who had attacked A-34 on the morning of 21st April 2010. These witnesses includeSajjna (DW-7), Rajesh (DW-17), Ram Niwas (DW-20), Dharambir (DW-21), and Praveen (DW-22).Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/85However, there is confusion as to whether they were naming A-34 or Rajender son of Satpal as theperson being attacked. They all spoke of A-25 being assaulted. However, it is of particular relevancethat all of these witnesses had stayed back in village Mirchpur after the incident and it appears tothis Court that they were won over by the accused persons. They have also materially contradictedtheir earlier statements to the police under Section 161 Cr PC, thereby rendering them unreliableand untrustworthy.267.13 There are therefore, no grounds made out by A-34 to set aside his conviction by the trialCourt. In that regard, Crl.A.226/2012, to the extent that it pertains to his conviction, deserves to bedismissed.267.14 A-34 is also a respondent in the appeals made by the State (Crl.A.1299/2012) and thecomplainants (Crl.A.139/2012). It has been sought by the Appellants in those appeals, that theconviction of A-34 be enhanced to include convictions under Sections 120B, 307, 148, 395, 397, 435,449, 450, and 452 IPC as well as under Sections 3(1)(x) and (xv) and 3(2)(iii) POA Act. Theseappeals have also sought the enhancement of the conviction under Section 304(II) IPC to that underSection 302 IPC.267.15 As regards the conviction of A-34 for the offence punishable under Section 304(II) IPC, forthe reasons already discussed, this Court is of the view that the offence is not one of culpablehomicide but one of murder punishable under Section 302 IPC. This is specific to the context of thekilling of Tara Chand and Suman. Thus, the culpability of A-34 in their killing by burning is provedbeyond reasonable doubt in light of the testimony of several PWs who name him as being involvedin the burning of the house of Tara Chand.267.16 Furthermore, it stands proved beyond reasonable doubt that in burning the house of TaraChand and Kamala (PW-50), A-34 had rendered it unfit for inhabitation and caused its completedestruction. Also, for the reasons already discussed, the prosecution has been able to prove thatA-34 was very much part of a criminal conspiracy to target and attack the Balmikis and was part ofthe riotous mob that went around torching the houses of the Balmikis.267.17 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-34 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/452/436 all readwith Section 149 IPC, Section 302 read with Section 120B IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv)POA Act read with Section 120B IPC. Seeing as the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 436IPC are punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v) POA Actstands attracted.A-38: Kulwinder son of Ram Mehar 268.1 He was identified in Court by PWs 32, 36, 38, 39, 42, 43,44, 45, 49, and 50 as well as by CW-1. PWs 32, 36, 38, 39, 42, and 45 have made general allegationsagainst this accused of having been involved in the riotous mob and attacking and causing damageto the properties of the Balmikis. PWs 43 and 44, the sons of Gulaba (PW-48), state that he wasresponsible for causing damage to their fathers house by arson. Most tellingly, PWs 49 and 50 aswell as CW-1 have named him as one of those involved in the burning of the house of Tara ChandKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/86which resulted in two deaths.268.2 Ms. Sumita Kapil, learned counsel appearing for A-38, has advanced more or less similararguments to those made in the appeal of A-34. This Court has already noted that all of theaforementioned witnesses were reliable and truthful in their testimonies notwithstanding that someof them might have named and identified the accused persons for the first time in Court. With A-38having been named by PW-50 in her statement to the police at the first instance, her identificationqua him is acceptable. Furthermore, merely because some politicians may have visited villageMirchpur subsequently did not mean that the testimonies of the key PWs were false.268.3 The Court also rejects the contention that simply because PW-43 was residing at thefarmhouse of Ved Pal Tanwar at the time of deposing in the trial, he was unreliable anduntrustworthy. While Ved Pal Tanwars political aspirations have never been concealed, it is entirelyanother matter to speculate that he has instigated witnesses to speak against the accused.Furthermore, the statement of PW-43 before the CoI constituted in the present case was of norelevance and could not be relied upon to vitiate his testimony. The Court also rejects the argumentthat his line of sight would have been occluded by other buildings as he was witnessing the incidentof rioting on the main gali from the roof of a two- storied house situated one "qilla" away. Withregards to the setting of his fathers house on fire he has clearly named A-38 as the person who,along with A-22, A-23, and A-34, set his house on fire.268.4 PW-44, the other son of Gulaba (PW-48), also speaks of A-38 sprinkling oil on the walls oftheir house before it was set on fire. The shop of ladies items which his wife used to run was alsodamaged in the fire. PW-44 withstood cross- examination and nothing emerged which discreditedhis testimony. The observation of the trial Court that the testimony of PW-44 was not believable ashe did not take his father to the hospital and did not suffer any injuries himself is unsustainable. TheMLC of Gulaba (PW-48) shows that he was taken to the hospital at 9:30 pm on 21st April 2010.This, therefore, did not disprove the presence of PW-44 at the scene of occurrence.268.5 There were two defence witnesses who were examined in support of A-38s case. Virender(DW-6) stated that on 21st April 2010, he along with A-2 and A-38 were in their field harvestingwheat till around 4 to 4:15 pm. DW-6 is a labourer who used to work in the fields of the Jatcommunity. He did not complain to anybody about the false arrest of A-2 or A-38. He appears to bea setup witness and is therefore, unreliable.268.6 As far as Chander Prakash (DW-40) is concerned, he suggested that smoke was coming fromone of the by-lanes where fuel in the form of uplas and thasras was lying stacked and the fire starteddue to these fuel dumps which thereafter started spreading to the neighbouring houses. This by nomeans disproved the case of the prosecution about the involvement of A-38 during the rioting.268.7 It was then submitted that mass MLCs were made on 30 th April 2010 only after theannouncement of an award of compensation by the Chief Minister of Haryana even though doctorswere present at the spot on the day of the incident itself. However, it is not for the Court to speculateas to why the medical examinations of some of the injured victims were not carried out on the day ofKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/87the incident itself. However, the depositions of the witnesses are cogent and convincing as regardsthe incident of 21st April 2010.268.8 It is also pointed out that of the MLCs placed on the record, 18 did not show witnesses havingsustained any injuries. The time gap between the date of the incident and their medical examinationcould explain why no injuries were found on some of these persons. In any event, this does notdiscredit their testimonies. Likewise, the non-recovery of the weapons which were in the form ofjellies and gandasis which were ordinary agricultural implements does not weaken the case of theprosecution. Stone pelting and exchange of brickbats has been spoken to by most of the PWs andwould normally result in injuries of a simple nature thus explaining the absence of injuries in theMLCs.268.9 Consequently, this Court finds no merit in the contentions raised on behalf of this accusedand in that view, Crl.A.129/2012 stands dismissed. Like in the case of A-34, the Appellants inCrl.A.139/2012 (complainants) and Crl.A.1299/2012 (State) have sought enhancement of theconviction of A-38 along similar lines.268.10 As regards the conviction of A-38 for the offence punishable under Section 304(II) IPC, forthe reasons already discussed, this Court is of the view that the offence is not one of culpablehomicide but one of murder punishable under Section 302 IPC. This is specific to the context of thekilling of Tara Chand and Suman. Thus, the culpability of A-38 in their killing by burning is provedbeyond reasonable doubt in light of the testimony of several PWs who name him as being involvedin the burning of the house of Tara Chand which resulted in his death of that of his daughter Suman.268.11 Furthermore, it stands proved beyond reasonable doubt that in burning the house of TaraChand and Kamala (PW-50), A-38 had rendered it unfit for inhabitation and caused its completedestruction. Also, for the reasons already discussed, the prosecution has been able to prove thatA-38 was very much part of a criminal conspiracy to target and attack the Balmikis and was part ofthe riotous mob that went around torching the houses of the Balmikis.268.12 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-38 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/452/436 all readwith Section 149 IPC, Section 302 read with Section 120B IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv)POA Act read with Section 120B IPC. Seeing as the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 436IPC are punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v) POA Actstands attracted.A-20: Ramphal son of Prithvi 269.1 He has been identified in the trial by PWs 10, 25, 29, 30, 38, 40,and 42 to 50 as well as by CW-1. The testimonies of PWs 40, 44, 47, and 49 as well as that of CW-1implicate him in the burning of the house of Tara Chand. PW-29 has named A-20 as one of the fourassailants who entered his house and caused grievous injuries to him before burning his shops andhouse. PW-42 also names him as one of those who were sprinkling oil on the walls of the shops ofDhoop Singh (PW-29) before it was burnt. He has been identified by PW-48 as the person who,along with A-34 and A-25, had come to his house with an oil container and set it on fire. OtherKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/88witnesses, such as PWs 25, 30, 43, and 45 have made general allegations against him of indulging inrioting and arson. The identification of this accused by PW-50 in the trial without having namedhim in her statement to the police under Section 161 Cr PC stands rejected.269.2 Mr. Jayant Sud, learned Senior Counsel, has appeared on behalf of A-20 and has advancedlargely similar arguments to those advanced on behalf of A-34 and A-38. With regard to the attackon Gulaba (PW-48), Mr. Sud submits that the version spoken to by PW-48 is not cogent andconsistent with the medical evidence on the record. However, it is seen that PW-48 has, in thestatements made by him under Section 161 Cr PC on 23rd April 2010 referred to the attack on himin which A-20 was also complicit. Therefore, he has been consistent on this aspect of the case andhis testimony cannot be rejected as unreliable.269.3 As regards the attack on Dhoop Singh (PW-29) who named A-20 as one of the assailants whoattacked him and caused grievous injuries to him, the trial Court has already held him to be areliable witness and the injuries suffered by him have been proved medically. He was categoricalthat it was A-20 who hit him with a lathi on his left arm and thereby caused a fracture. PW-29 andhis son PW-42 also identified A-20 as one of those who participated in the burning of their houseand shops. The evidence of PW-42 is reliable and cannot be disregarded merely because he did notaccompany Dhoop Singh (PW-29) to the hospital.269.4 The third incident in which A-20 is implicated is the burning of the house of Tara Chandwhich resulted in the death of Tara Chand and his differently abled daughter Suman. Hisinvolvement in the said incident has been spoken to by PWs 40, 44, 47, and 49 as well as CW-1. Allof these witnesses have been held to be reliable and their testimonies provide sufficient evidence toestablish the guilt of A-20 as far as the burning of the house of Tara Chand is concerned.269.5 It is submitted that the Supreme Court, in Vijay Pandurang Thakre v. State of Maharashtra(2017) 4 SCC 377, has opined that the expression "in prosecution of the common object" postulatesthat the act must be one which has been done with a view to accomplish the common objectattributed to the members of the unlawful assembly. This Court finds that the prosecution hasadequately proved the acts done by A-20 in prosecution of the common object which was to attackthe Balmiki community and cause injury and damage to their persons and properties in a bid toteach them a lesson for a perceived insult against the Jat community. Reliance is sought to be madeon the decision in Dilaver Hussain v. State of Gujarat (1991) 1 SCC 253 but this Court does not find itto be helpful to the case of A-20.269.6 Consequently, the Court rejects the arguments made on behalf of A-20 and in that view,Crl.A.226/2012, insofar as it pertains to him, stands dismissed. Like in the cases of A-34 and A-38,the Appellants in Crl.A.139/2012 (complainants) and Crl.A.1299/2012 (State) have soughtenhancement of the conviction of A-20 along similar lines.269.7 As regards the conviction of A-20 for the offence punishable under Section 304(II) IPC, forthe reasons already discussed, this Court is of the view that the offence is not one of culpablehomicide but one of murder punishable under Section 302 IPC. This is specific to the context of theKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/89killing of Tara Chand and Suman. Thus, the culpability of A-20 in their killing by burning is provedbeyond reasonable doubt in light of the testimony of several PWs who name him as being involvedin the burning of the house of Tara Chand which resulted in his death of that of his daughter Suman.269.8 Furthermore, it stands proved beyond reasonable doubt that in burning the houses of TaraChand, Kamala (PW-50), and Dhoop Singh (PW-29), A-20 had rendered them unfit for inhabitationand caused their complete destruction. His guilt in causing grievous injuries to PW-29 also standsestablished. Also, for the reasons already discussed, the prosecution has been able to prove thatA-20 was very much part of a criminal conspiracy to target and attack the Balmikis and was part ofthe riotous mob that went around torching the houses of the Balmikis.269.9 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-20 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 325/427/452/436 all readwith Section 149 IPC, Section 302 read with Section 120B IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv)POA Act read with Section 120B IPC. Seeing as the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 436IPC are punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v) POA Actstands attracted.270. The Court shall now proceed to discuss the convictions of A-3, A-25, and A-13, all three ofwhom, along with A-42 and A-94 (both since deceased), were convicted by the trial Court for theoffences punishable under Section 147 IPC and Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC.They were also convicted for the offence punishable under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act whichsupercedes the conviction under Section 435 IPC. While A-3 and A-13 have preferredCrl.A.210/2012, A-25 has preferred Crl.A.190/2012. Crl.A.210/2012 stands abated insofar as itpertains to the challenge against the conviction of A-94.A-3: Karambir son of Tara Chand 271.1 He has been represented by learned counsel Mr. M.N.Dudeja. The relevant witnesses who have spoken about his involvement are PWs 33, 39, 43, 44, 45,49, and 50. PWs 39, 44, and 45 have all identified A-3 as being one of the rioters who set theirhouses on fire. The remaining witnesses have spoken about A-3 indulging in stone pelting andattacking Balmikis with lathis whilst being a member of an unlawful assembly.271.2 For reasons already explained hereinbefore, this Court rejects all attempts made by Mr.Dudeja to vitiate the testimonies of the abovementioned witnesses on the ground that some of themhave identified the accused for the first time in the trial with no mention of his name being made bythem to the police at the first instance. Further, the testimony of PW-39 is not liable to rejectionmerely because he had undergone eye surgery one month prior to the incident. PW-45 whose housewas burnt by this accused has named him in his statement to the police as well as identified himduring the trial, making his testimony qua this accused reliable. The Court has also already laiddown its reasoning in rejecting the contention that testimonies such as that of PW-43 ought to berejected as the witnesses were permitted by the trial Court to refresh their memory.271.3 In that view of the matter, Crl.A.210/2012, insofar as it challenges the conviction of A-3,stands dismissed. On the other hand, the Appellants in Crl.A.139/2012 (complainants) andKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/90Crl.A.1299/2012 (State) have sought enhancement of the sentence awarded to A-3 to includeconvictions under Sections 120B, 302, 307, 148, 395, 397, 436, 449, 450, 452 IPC as well as underSections 3(1)(x) and (xv) and 3(2)(iv) and (v) POA Act.271.4 With PWs 49 and 50 both naming him in their respective statements to the police at the firstinstance under Section 161 Cr PC as well as identifying him in Court as one of the members of thegroup of assailants who attacked the house of Tara Chand, it stands established that he is guilty ofhaving burnt the dwelling home of a Balmiki in such a manner that it was completely destroyed anduninhabitable.271.5 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-3 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/436 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as theoffence punishable under Section 436 IPC is punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years ormore, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act stands attracted.A-25: Karampal son of Satbir 272.1 He has been represented by learned counsel Mr. Jitendra Sethiand was identified by PWs 36, 42, 44, 45, 48, 49, and 50 and CW-1, all of whom the Court hasalready found to be reliable notwithstanding that some of them may have identified him for the firsttime in the trial with no mention made by them of his name to the police at the first instance. PWs36, 42, and 45 have identified him as one of the rioters indulging in stone pelting. PWs 44 and 48have accused him of having burnt their houses. PW-49 names him as one of those indulging in arsonand CW-1 specifically alleges that he was one of those dancing naked on the main gali.272.2 PW-50 failed to mention the name of this accused in her statement to the police at the firstinstance and therefore, her dock identification of him is rejected. Nevertheless, several witnesseshave spoken to his participating in the rioting and arson that took place on 21st April 2010 in cogentand reliable manner. Thus, Crl.A.190/2012 preferred by him is dismissed. Like with A-3, theAppellants in Crl.A.139/2012 (complainants) and Crl.A.1299/2012 (State) have sought enhancementof the conviction awarded to A-25 along similar lines.272.3 On the question of enhancement of this accuseds conviction, the Court is of the view thatwhile his participation in the burning of properties of the Balmikis as part of the riotous mob whichcame prepared to attack stands proved beyond reasonable doubt, no evidence emerges from therecord which proves his direct involvement in the destruction of the houses of Tara Chand, Kamala(PW-50), and Dhoop Singh (PW-29) so as to make them uninhabitable. Furthermore, nothingemerges which suggests his participation in the killing of Tara Chand and Suman and thus, he hasrightly been acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.272.4 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-25 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is furthernoted that the conviction under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction underSection 435 IPC.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/91A-13: Dharambir son of Mai Chand 273.1 He has been represented by learned counsel Mr. AjayVerma and was identified by PWs 36, 37, 38, 40, 42, 44, 48, and 50. All of these witnesses have beenheld by this Court to be reliable and the contention that some of them have identified him for thefirst time during the trial and are thus not reliable is rejected. He is implicated in stone pelting,damaging property, and attacking Balmikis by PWs 36, 37, 38, and 44. Meanwhile PWs 40, 42, and48 have accused him of indulging in arson. With her having failed to name this accused to the policein her statement at the first instance, the identification by PW-50 is rejected.273.2 He has examined Ramphal (DW-31) in leading defence evidence who has stated that in theyears 2007 and 2009, A-13 was the highest bidder for the offering rights at the Mata Phoolan Devitemple. How this particular piece of evidence could help the case of the accused is unclear. Keepingin view the consistent and corroborated testimonies which are available on the record, this Court issatisfied that his guilt has been established beyond reasonable doubt. In that view of the matter,Crl.A.210/2012 is dismissed insofar as it challenges the conviction of A-13. The Appellants inCrl.A.139/2012 (complainants) and Crl.A.1299/2012 (State) have sought enhancement of theconviction awarded to A-13.273.3 On the question of enhancement of this accuseds conviction, the Court is of the view thatwhile his participation in the burning of properties of the Balmikis as part of the riotous mob whichcame prepared to attack stands proved beyond reasonable doubt, no evidence emerges from therecord which proves his direct involvement in the destruction of the houses of Tara Chand, Kamala(PW-50), and Dhoop Singh (PW-29) so as to make them uninhabitable. Furthermore, nothingemerges which suggests his participation in the killing of Tara Chand and Suman and thus, he hasrightly been acquitted of the offence punishable under Section 302 IPC.273.4 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-13 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is furthernoted that the conviction under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction underSection 435 IPC.274. The Court now proceeds to consider the cases of A-27, A-64, A-90, A-65, A-41, and A-39, all ofwhom, along with A-23 (since deceased), were convicted for the offences punishable under Section147 IPC and Sections 323 and 427 read with Section 149 IPC. They were sentenced to the period ofimprisonment already undergone and were placed under probation for a period of one year in termsof the Probation of Offenders Act 1958 upon their furnishing bonds in the sum of Rs.10,000/- andsurety of the like amount. In case of any default or repetition of offence, they were sentenced toundergo SI for one year. None of these convicted accused have preferred appeals. However, theyhave been issued notices in Crl.A.139/2012 (complainants) and Crl.A.1299/2012 (State) by both ofwhich it has been prayed that their convictions be enhanced. A-23, who was issued notice, is sincedeceased and thus, the appeals qua him stand abated.A-27: Sumit son of Satyawan 275.1 He has been represented by learned counsel Mr. Ajay Verma andwas identified by PWs 42, 45 and 49, all of whom are reliable. PW-42 has identified him as beingKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/92part of the Jat community mob and has specifically stated that he was dancing naked after burningthe houses of the Balmikis. Meanwhile, PW-45 has stated that the accused came to his house andhad set it on fire. He also mentions A-27 burning the motorcycle belonging to his brother-in-law.PW-49 also mentions him indulging in arson and rioting.275.2 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-27 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is furthernoted that the conviction under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction underSection 435 IPC.A-64: Pradeep son of Jaibir 276.1 He has been represented by learned counsel Mr. SudhershanRajan and was identified by PWs 36, 42, and 49. From a cumulative reading of their testimonies, itemerges that A-64 was a member of the mob and was seen entering the houses of the Balmikis anddamaging household properties. He is also attributed with having sprinkled oil on the walls of theshop of PW-29 and setting it on fire. PW-49 also accuses him of participating in arson and rioting.276.2 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-64 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/436 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as theoffence punishable under Section 436 IPC is punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years ormore, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act stands attracted.A-90: Rajpal son of Sheo Chand 277.1 He has been represented by learned counsel Mr. M.N. Dudejaand was identified by PWs 42, 43, and 50 as being part of the rioting mob. PW-42 has spoken of himbeing one of those who sprinkled oil on the walls of the shop of PW-29 and set it on fire. PW-43identified him by name and by pointing out as the person who broke down the door of his house andset it on fire. As regards the identification of this accused by PW-50, this Court finds that itunreliable for the reason that his name does not find mention in the statement by her at the firstinstance to the police. Nevertheless, there being two other witnesses to the offences perpetrated byA-90, this Court is satisfied as to his guilt.277.2 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-90 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/436 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as theoffence punishable under Section 436 IPC is punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years ormore, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act stands attracted.A-65: Pradeep son of Suresh 278.1 Mr. Anupam Sharma, learned counsel appearing on his behalf,has sought to discredit the testimonies of the witnesses, viz. PWs 42, 45, 49, and 50, who haveidentified A-65 as being a member of the mob which attacked the Balmiki basti.PW-42 has deposed to A-65 being part of the group of accused who were sprinkling oil on the wallsof the shop of PW-29 before setting it on fire. PW-45 as well has spoken to him being one of thoseKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/93who were indulging in stone pelting and arson in the Balmiki basti. While PW-49 has pointed himout as one of those present at the spot at the time of rioting, the identification by PW-50 is rejectedfor the reason that she did not name him in her statement to the police made at the first instance.278.2 Learned counsel Mr. Sharma has averred that no specific role has been attributed to A-65 byany of the witnesses who identified him. Further, he submits that no incriminating recoveries weremade from A-65 and that the pictures of the burnt houses were not shown to the victims at the timeof their deposing in the trial. However, this Court does not believe that any of these submissionswould cancel out the clear and corroborated evidence that appears on the record implicating theaccused in the ghastly violence which occurred in the village on 21st April 2010.278.3 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-65 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/436 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as theoffence punishable under Section 436 IPC is punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years ormore, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act stands attracted.A-41: Sunil son of Dayanand 279.1 Mr. M.L. Yadav, learned counsel appearing on his behalf, submitsthat although he has been identified in the trial by PWs 42, 48, 49, and 50, dock identificationswould be impermissible especially considering no TIP was conducted. This Court has alreadyrecorded its observations regarding the non- conduct of TIP in this case and has arrived at theconclusion that this oversight would not obviate the testimonies of these reliable and trustworthywitnesses whose presence at the time of the incident has been established.279.2 At the outset, it is to be noted that PW-50 has not mentioned the name of this accused in herstatement to the police at the first instance and in that circumstance, her dock identification of A-41is rejected. PW-48 states that this accused was one of those indulging in arson, stone throwing, andrioting while PW-42 also identified him as a member of the rioting mob. PW-49 too has stated thatA-41 was one of the assailants who were indulging in rioting and arson.279.3 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-41 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is furthernoted that the conviction under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction underSection 435 IPC.A-39: Monu son of Suresh 280.1 Represented by learned counsel Mr. Jitender Sethi, this accusedhas been identified by PWs 38, 44, 49, and 50. PWs 38 and 44 have identified this accused as onewho was indulging in stone pelting and arson and had jellies in his hand. PW-49 has identified himas part of the group of accused who were indulging in rioting and arson. The identification of thisaccused by PW-50 is liable to be rejected for the reason that he was not named by her in herstatement to the police under Section 161 Cr PC.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/94280.2 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-39 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read withSection 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is furthernoted that the conviction under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction underSection 435 IPC.A-58: Jasbir @ Lillu son of Raja 281.1 The State, by way of Crl.A.1472/2013, has soughtenhancement of the conviction of A-58 who, by the judgment dated 6th October 2012 in SCNo.1238A/2012, was acquitted of all charges except that under Section 174A IPC to which hepleaded guilty. Consequently, he was sentenced to six months RI along with fine of Rs.2,000/- andin default of payment of fine, to undergo further SI for a period of 15 days.281.2 He has been represented by learned counsel Mr. R.P. Luthra and was identified by PWs 36,38, 42, and 50. At the outset, the identification of this accused by PW-50 is liable to be discarded ashis name does not find mention in her original statement to the police. PW-36 names A-58 as one ofthose who was "having a lathi in his hand and was first indulging in stone pelting and then wasroaming around in the galis with lathi in his hand". PW-38 has made a general allegation againstA-58 of being involved in stone pelting, assault, looting, and arson. Meanwhile, PW-42 names himas one of those who broke into the shop of PW-29 and caused damaged to the properties therein.281.3 In view of the above discussion, the conviction of A-39 is modified and he hereby standsconvicted for the offences punishable under Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read withSection 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B.Accused persons acquitted by the trial Court282. Having dealt with the convictions of those who have been convicted by the trial Court, theCourt now proceeds to consider the case of those acquitted accused who were arrayed asRespondents in Crl.A.139/2012 (complainants), Crl.A.1472/2013 (State), and Crl.A.1299/2012(State). In all, notices were issued to 42 acquitted accused of which A-17 is since deceased andtherefore, the appeals qua him stand abated.283. Before proceeding to discuss the individual cases of the acquitted Respondents, it would benecessary for this Court to examine its powers in reversing a judgment of acquittal by the trial Court.In this context, the powers of the appellate Court have been clearly explained by the Supreme Courtin Bhagwan Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2003) 3 SCC 21 as under:"7. We do not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the appellantsthat under Section 378 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the High Court could notdisturb the finding of facts of the trial court even if it found that the view taken by thetrial court was not proper. On the basis of the pronouncements of this Court, thesettled position of law regarding the powers of the High Court in an appeal against anorder of acquittal is that the Court has full powers to review the evidence upon whichan order of acquittal is based and generally it will not interfere with the order ofKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/95acquittal because by passing an order of acquittal the presumption of innocence infavour of the accused is reinforced. The golden thread which runs through the web ofadministration of justice in criminal case is that if two views are possible on theevidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the accused and the other tohis innocence, the view which is favourable to the accused should be adopted. Such isnot a jurisdiction limitation on the appellate court but a Judge made guidelines forcircumspection. The paramount consideration of the court is to ensure thatmiscarriage of justice is avoided. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from theacquittal of guilty is no less than from the conviction of an innocent. In a case wherethe trial court has taken a view ignoring the admissible evidence, a duty is cast uponthe High Court to re-appreciate the evidence in acquittal appeal for the purposes ofascertaining as to whether all or any of the accused has committed any offence or not.Probable view taken by the trial court which may not be disturbed in the appeal issuch a view which is based upon legal and admissible evidence."284. In Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi) (supra), the Supreme Courtobserved as under:"... The appellate court has all the necessary powers to re-evaluate the evidence let inbefore the trial court as well as the conclusions reached. It has a duty to specify thecompelling and substantial reasons in case it reverses the order of acquittal passed bythe trial court. In the case on hand, the High Court by adhering to all the ingredientsand by giving cogent and adequate reasons reversed the order of acquittal."285. Further, in Khurshid Ahmed v. State of J&K (supra), the Supreme Court held:"33. The power of the appellate Court in an appeal against acquittal is the same asthat of an appeal against conviction. But, in an appeal against acquittal, the Court hasto bear in mind that the presumption of innocence is in favour of the accused and it isstrengthened by the order of acquittal. At the same time, appellate Court will notinterfere with the order of acquittal mainly because two views are possible, but onlywhen the High Court feels that the appreciation of evidence is based on erroneousconsiderations and when there is manifest illegality in the conclusion arrived at bythe trial Court. In the present case, there was manifest irregularity in the appreciationof evidence by the trial Court. The High Court based on sound principles of criminaljurisprudence, has interfered with the judgment of acquittal passed by the trial Courtand convicted the accused as the prosecution was successful in proving the guilt ofthe accused beyond reasonable doubt."286. Thus, the position in law which emerges from the decisions of the Supreme Court citedhereinabove is that where there has been a manifest irregularity in the appreciation of evidence bythe trial Court, the appellate Court might interfere with the judgment of acquittal by the trial Courtand instead convict the accused if it is satisfied that the prosecution has been successful inestablishing their guilt. In the present case, as has already been discussed at great lengthKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/96hereinbefore, the trial Court has gravely erred in discarding the testimonies of a majority of the keyPWs who were in fact reliable and trustworthy. Thus, this Court has taken it upon itself tore-appreciate this evidence so as to prevent the miscarriage of justice which would result from thewrongful acquittals of guilty individuals.287. In that context, the Court now proceeds to discuss the individual cases of the acquitted accused.For the sake of convenience, the Court has chosen to deal with those accused represented by acommon counsel together.Respondents represented by Mr. M.N. Dudeja288. The Court shall first deal with the submissions made by learned counsel Mr. M.N. Dudeja whohas appeared for the acquitted accused A-22, A-77, and A-78. His first submission pertains to whathe argues is a lack of reliable witnesses and the absence of clear and cogent evidence which wouldpoint to the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. He argues that the testimonies of the eyewitnesses in the present case are riddled with falsehoods and cites the decision of the SupremeCourt in State of U.P. v. Shanker AIR 1981 SC 897 in support of his submission that testimonies inwhich trust and falsehood are inextricably intertwined should be rejected. Further, he states thatmajor improvements have been made by witnesses while deposing in the trial and that no specificevidence emerges which attributes a specific role in the violence to any of the accused. He alsoargues the dock identification of the accused for the first time by a number of witnesses is liable tobe rejected.289. All these submissions on the aspect of the reliability of the eye witness testimonies on therecord in the present case have been dealt with by this Court hereinbefore. It would suffice to say atthis point that this Court is of the opinion that the key eye witnesses examined by the prosecutionappear reliable and trustworthy and their testimonies reveal in sufficient detail the extent of theviolence perpetrated by the Jat community mob on 21 st April 2010. In that view, this Court rejectsthese submissions of Mr. Dudeja on the aspect of the reliability of eye witnesses. It is to be noted,however, that this Court, as has been noted hereinbefore, is in concurrence with his submissionregarding the requirement of identification by at least two eye witnesses in cases involvingallegations of membership of an unlawful assembly.290. Mr. Dudeja then proceeds to argue that the trial Courts decision to permit the asking of leadingquestions during the examination of key PWs was bad in law and obviated the right of the accused toa fair trial. He also states that there can only one set of rules and standards when it comes to trials incriminal cases unless the statute provides for anything to be specifically applicable to a particularcase or class of cases. Both of these arguments have already been dealt with earlier in this judgmentand are liable to be rejected.291. He then argues that the FSL reports do not corroborate the claims of oil being sprinkled on thehouses of the Balmikis before they were burnt. However, once again, this Court is not convinced bythis argument for reasons already recorded hereinbefore. His submissions regarding the truegenesis of the violence on 21st April 2010 and the purported suppression of the incident whichKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/97occurred on that morning do not resonate with this Court and lacks any sort of evidentiary basis inview of this Courts discussion of the alternate theory put forth by the defence hereinbefore.292. In the context of the above discussion, the Court now proceeds to consider the individual casesof the acquitted accused represented by Mr. Dudeja.A-22: Pradeep son of Balwan 293.1 He has been identified as being present at the time of rioting byPWs 43, 44, and 50. He is named by PW-43 as one of those who sprinkled kerosene on his houseand set it on fire. Similarly, PW-44 has also named him as being one of the assailants who set hishouse on fire. PW-50 has named this accused in her statement to the police at the first instance andhas also identified him in Court as one of the assailants present at the spot at the relevant time whowere indulging in rioting, looting, and arson.293.2 The submission of Mr. Dudeja, in terms of the decision in Binay Kumar Singh v. State of Bihar(1997) 1 SCC 283, that the conviction for an accusation of involvement in an unlawful assemblyshould be based the testimonies of at least two reliable witnesses therefore stands satisfied as in thepresent case, three reliable witnesses have deposed to his presence at the spot and have evenattributed specific actions to him in the burning of properties belonging to the Balmiki community.293.4 In view of the above discussion, A-22 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is further noted that the conviction under Section3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction under Section 435 IPC.A-77: Sanjay @ Handa son of Dayanand 294.1 He has been identified by PW-29 as one of theassailants who entered his home and dealt blows to this leg with a danda before going on to set fireto his shops which eventually spread to his house. PW-36 too has spoken of this accused enteringthe house of PW-29 and causing injuries to him before setting his house on fire. PW-42, the son ofPW-29, has also spoken of A-77 sprinkling oil on the walls of his fathers shop and setting it on fire.Furthermore, PW-45 has identified him as being one of the boys indulging in stone pelting, arson,and burning of houses in the Balmiki basti.294.2 This Court has already recorded its observation that the testimony of a witness who is reliableand cogent cannot be discarded simply because the accused was not mentioned in the statementsmade by these witnesses under Section 161 Cr PC at the first instance. In fact, PW-42 has named thisaccused in his original statement to the police. Furthermore, the Court notes that multiple witnesseshave spoken of their statements being incorrectly recorded by the police.294.3 In view of the above discussion, A-77 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 325/427/452/436 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as the offence punishable underSection 436 IPC is punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v)POA Act stands attracted.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/98A-78: Satyawan @ Satta Singh son of Karan Singh 295.1 He has been identified by at least fourwitnesses, viz. PWs 25, 36, 37, and45. PW-36 specifically alleges that he was indulging in stone pelting and entering the houses of theBalmikis and destroying household articles. PW-37 and PW-45 have spoken to this accusedindulging in arson and the specific act of burning the motorcycle of Sunil son of Brijbhan has beenattributed to him.295.2 Mr. Dudeja has referred to the testimony of Pasha (DW-15) who testified that when he went tocollect beehives from the fields on 21 st April 2010, at around 12 noon, he saw A-78 there harvestinghis crop. However, it appears to this Court that such testimony has been made by a witness whoselivelihood is dependant upon the Jat community which is dominant in village Mirchpur. Histestimony does not appear reliable and trustworthy and does little to dislodge the overwhelmingevidence available on the record pointing to the presence of the accused at the relevant time.295.3 In view of the above discussion, A-78 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is further noted that the conviction under Section3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction under Section 435 IPC.Respondents represented by Mr. Ajay Verma296. The Court now proceeds to discuss the individual cases of those acquitted accused representedby learned counsel Mr. Ajay Verma, viz. A-89, A-83, A-43, A-76, A-15, and A-60.A-89: Jokhar @ Joginder son of Inder Singh 297.1 He was identified in the trial by PWs 42, 49, and50. At the outset, it is to be noted that the dock identification of this accused by PW-50 is liable to berejected for the reason that he was not named by her in the statement to the police at the firstinstance. PW-42 has named him as one of the group of assailants who came to the shop of PW-29and indulged in "tor phor" and caused damage to their property. PW-49 has also named him as oneof the assailants present at the spot at the relevant time attacking the Balmikis.297.2 In view of the above discussion, A-89 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.A-83: Sonu @ Monu son of Ramesh 298.1 Like A-89, he too has been identified in the trial by PWs42, 49, and 50. He was named by PW-42 as one of those having a danda in his hand and hittingpersons from the Balmiki community and also indulging in "tor phor" and causing damage to theproperties of the Balmikis. PW-49 has identified him as one of those present at the time of therioting. The identification made by PW-50 is liable to be rejected on the ground that she did notname this accused in her initial statement to the police under Section 161 Cr PC.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/99298.2 Pasha (DW-15) has deposed that in the course of collecting beehives from the fields on themorning of 21 st April 2010, he went to the field owned by the family of A-83 and saw himharvesting wheat there. However, as has been noted with respect to A-78, this witness appears to theCourt to be one who is deposing out of fear of repercussions from the dominant Jat community inthe village upon whom his livelihood depends. His testimony does not appear reliable andtrustworthy and does little to dislodge the overwhelming evidence available on the record pointingto the presence of the accused at the relevant time.298.3 In view of the above discussion, A-83 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.Rajesh son of Dhupa (A-43), Sanjay @ Sandeep son of Amar Lal (A-76), Jitender son of Satbir(A-53), Kuldeep @ Midda son of Balbir (A-15), and Naseeb son of Prem Singh (A-60)299. All of these acquitted accused have been identified by PW-50 for the first time in Court with nomention of their names being made by her in the statement made to the police at the first instance.As has already been discussed, this Court has chosen not to rely on such dock identification byPW-50. Apart from PW-50, each of these accused have been identified in Court by only one otherreliable witness, i.e. PW-40 in the case of A-43, PW-48 in the case of A-60, and PW-42 in the casesof A-76, A-53, and A-15. In view of the principle laid down in Masalti v. State of U.P. (supra), thisCourt finds there to be insufficient material on the record to convict any of these accused persons. Inthat view, the acquittals of these accused persons are upheld and the appeals by the complainantsand the State are dismissed insofar as they pertain to them.Respondents represented by Mr. Sudarshan Rajan300. The Court next deals with the submissions made by learned counsel Mr. Sudarshan Rajan whohas appeared on behalf of A-1, A-29, A-79, A-18, A-5, A-52, A-66, and A-63. At the outset, hesubmits that the POA Act would not be applicable to the present case as the offences were notcommitted on the ground that the victims belonged to a Scheduled Caste. He has placed reliance onthe decisions in Dinesh @ Buddha v. State of Rajasthan (supra) and Masumsha HasanashaMusalman v. State of Maharashtra (supra) in this regard. He further submits that as per Section3(2)(v) POA Act as it stood prior to amendment, it was not enough to show mere knowledge on thepart of the accused of the victims membership of a Scheduled Caste but in fact, the prosecution hadto fulfil its burden of showing that the offences were committed against them on the ground thatthey belonged to a Scheduled Caste. Reliance is placed upon the decision in Asharfi v. State of U.P.(supra) in that regard. This Court has already discussed these submissions at length and for reasonsalready stated hereinbefore, is not persuaded by them.301. A third limb of his submission is that it was necessary to examine whether the accused wouldhave reacted in the same manner in case the motive for such incident existed against any othercommunity and not necessarily persons belonging to a Scheduled Caste. Here it is submitted thatsince the trigger for the incident on 21st April 2010 was a rumour that A-34 had been eitherKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/100kidnapped or killed, the reaction of the Jat community would have been no different even if thepersons responsible belonged to a community other than a Scheduled Caste.302. However, this submission conveniently overlooks the incident of 19th April 2010 and theconspiracy hatched on 20 th April 2010 by the members of the Jat community in village Mirchpurwith a view to specifically targeting members of the Balmiki community. The prosecution has beenable to demonstrate that the acts of arson, rioting and looting that took place on 21st April 2010were by the members of the Jat community mob and were specifically targeted at the members ofthe Balmiki community. Therefore, there is no scope for accepting the above submission that themembers of the Jat community would have reacted no differently to the rumour that A-34 had beenabducted/killed even if such abduction/killing was done by members of a community other than aScheduled Caste. In the considered view of the Court, this was undoubtedly an incident of castebased violence and has been proved to be as such by the prosecution.303. The next submission of Mr. Rajan was that this was a case of faulty investigation. He referredto the order sheet of the trial Court dated 7 th March 2011 and submitted that there had been falseimplication of persons who were not even present at the spot. In particular he referred to thesubmissions of Rakesh son of Amar Lal (A-55) and Manbir son of Zile Singh (A-59). According tohim, the State was supporting the complainants. He further points out that the State itself hadrecommended a CBI investigation in the matter as is recorded in the order dated 20th January 2011and this was opposed by the complainants themselves.304. The Court again does not find anything significant in the above submissions. The fact is thatthere was no reference of the case to the CBI and the trial proceeded from the stage of framing ofcharges before the trial Court in Delhi pursuant to the orders of the Supreme Court. The trial Courthas in fact recorded its views on the faulty investigation and these have been adverted to earlier. TheCourt has also dealt with the submissions that many of the alleged victims had not suffered injuriesand only gave statements to the police after the Chief Minister announced compensation pursuantto his visit to Mirchpur on 27th April 2010.305. The Court would not like to discuss this aspect further as it has already been dealt with earlier.Suffice to note that a large number of victim families in fact left Mirchpur and moved into thefarmhouse of Ved Pal Tanwar. They have continued to remain there even eight years after theincident. The atmosphere of fear created by the members of the dominant Jat community wasevidently so severe that the confidence of the members of the Balmiki community about their safetyand security in Mirchpur is yet to be restored. It is too cynical to characterise the statements givenby many of the victims as having been motivated only by the expectation of the compensationannounced by the government. Many of the victims lost their properties, were injured, and had theirhouses burnt. The trauma and shock of the incident has left such deep scars that many of themcould not gather the courage to speak to the police for many days thereafter. It is in this context thatthe Court is disinclined to accept any of these submissions regarding alleged false implication of theaccused by the victims.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/101306. The Court also does not consider it necessary to deal with the submissions of Mr. Rajan that ifthis was indeed a case of faulty investigation, the complainants have not exercised all of theremedies available to them in accordance with law. As has been shown by this Court, the evidencegathered by the prosecution was sufficient to bring home the guilt of of the relevant accused. Theconsidered view of the Court is that the trial Court has wrongly rejected the evidence of many of thePWs as being unreliable and this too has already been discussed earlier.307. The submission of Mr. Rajan that there is no evidence to show that the victims belonged to aScheduled Caste has already been dealt with and rejected by this Court. It has been noted earlierthat the Balmiki caste is listed under Entry No.2 of Part V of the Schedule to the Constitution(Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 as amended by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders(Amendment) Act, 1976. Furthermore, his submission regarding the requisite number of reliable eyewitnesses to uphold a conviction for membership of an unlawful assembly has also already beendealt with.308. As far as the quality of the evidence is concerned, the Court is satisfied that there is sufficientevidence to show the involvement of certain accused persons in the incident of 21st April 2010. TheCourt also rejects the submission that specific roles have not been attributed to each of the accused.The Court has already made reference to the observations in Inder Singh v. State of Rajasthan(supra) and State of U.P. v. Dan Singh (supra) wherein the Supreme Court has explained the lawthat it is not necessary that the prosecution should specifically attribute a role to each of themembers of an unlawful assembly as long as it is able to show that they were indeed members ofsuch unlawful assembly. The Court is of the view that the said test stands fully satisfied in thepresent case with regard to some of the accused represented by Mr. Rajan.309. Mr. Rajan placed reliance on the decision of the Rajasthan High Court in Mani Ram v. State ofRajasthan 1994 Cri LJ 3770 which in turn has relied on a decision of the Supreme Court in RamNarain Singh v. State of Punjab (1975) 4 SCC 497. The ratio of the last mentioned judgment of theSupreme Court is to the effect that if the deposition of the PWs is totally inconsistent with themedical evidence and the forensic evidence, it would discredit the entire prosecution case. It wouldappear from a reading of that judgment that the Supreme Court disbelieved the ocular evidencesince it was wholly inconsistent with the medical evidence on the record. However, in the presentcase the ocular testimony is credible and trustworthy notwithstanding any immaterialinconsistencies with the medical evidence on the record. In this regard, it would be wise to heed theobservation of the Supreme Court in Krishnan v. State (2003) 7 SCC 56 that "it would be erroneousto accord undue primacy to the hypothetical answers of medical witnesses to exclude theeye-witnesses account which had to be tested independently and not treated as the variable keepingthe medical evidence as the constant". Another aspect to be kept in mind is the considerable efflux oftime between the date of the incident and the dates on which the medical examinations of many ofthe witnesses were conducted. Thus, Mr. Rajans submission in this regard also fails.310. The Court has already dealt with the objection of the defence about reliability of the PWs whohave identified the accused for the first time in Court. As already explained earlier, as long as the eyewitness account is found to be credible and trustworthy, it cannot be rejected only because theKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/102identification by such PWs was done for the first time in the Court.311. Thus, having considered the submissions made by Mr. Rajan, the Court now proceeds toconsider the individual cases of the acquitted accused on whose behalf he appears.A-1: Dharambir son of Tara Chand 312.1 He has been identified by PWs 36, 49, and 50 in the trial.He has also been named in the statement made by PW-50 to the police at the first instance so heridentification of this accused is relied upon by this Court. PW-36 names him as one of the accusedwho were burning the houses of the Balmikis.312.2 With PWs 49 and 50 both naming him in their respective statements to the police at the firstinstance under Section 161 Cr PC as well as identifying him in Court as one of the members of thegroup of assailants who attacked the house of Tara Chand, it stands established that he is guilty ofhaving burnt the dwelling home of a Balmiki person in such a manner that it was completelydestroyed and uninhabitable.312.3 In view of the above discussion, A-1 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishable underSection 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/436 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as the offence punishable under Section 436 IPC ispunishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act standsattracted.A-29: Roshan Lal son of Ram Swaroop 313.1 He has been identified by PWs 42, 45, and 50. Thedock identification of this accused by PW-50 is rejected as she did not name him in her statementunder Section 161 Cr PC. PW-42 has identified him as one of the assailants who was carrying adanda and hitting Balmikies and causing damage to the properties of the Balmikis. PW-45 hasspoken of him being a member of the mob indulging in stone pelting.313.2 In view of the above discussion, A-29 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.A-79: Satish son of Randhir 314.1 He has been identified by PWs 38, 40, 45, and 50 during the trial.At the outset, the dock identification by PW-50 is liable to be rejected for the reason that she did notname the accused in her statement under Section 161 Cr PC. PW-38 has spoken of him entering hishouse and indulging in looting and destruction of his property. PW-40 has named him as one ofthose indulging in stone pelting while PW-45 has also made a similar allegation of him being part ofthe mob which was indulging in stone pelting.314.2 In view of the above discussion, A-79 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/103A-52: Jogal @ Doger son of Hawa Singh 315.1 He was identified during the trial by PWs 29, 36, 38,40, 42, 45, and 50. PW-50 failed to mention the name of this accused in her statement to the policeat the first instance and therefore, her dock identification of him stands rejected. However, PW-29has spoken of him being one of the assailants who entered the compound of his house by breakingthe door and thereafter broke the water tank and set fire to his shops. PWs 36, 38, and 45 have allnamed him as one of those indulging in stone pelting and causing damage to Balmiki properties.PW-42 too has accused him of hitting Balmikis with a danda and causing damage to theirproperties. Further, PW-40 has specifically named him as one of those setting the houses of theBalmiki community on fire. Therefore, his presence in the village at the time of rioting standsestablished by ample evidence and more specifically, his culpability in the incident of causinggrievous injuries to PW-29 and the burning of his house and shops stands established.315.2 In view of the above discussion, A-52 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 325/427/452/436 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as the offence punishable underSection 436 IPC is punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v)POA Act stands attracted.A-66: Pradeep son of Satbir 316.1 In the trial, he was identified as one of the assailants by PWs 30,36, 42, 44, 45, 48, and 50. His dock identification by PW-50 is rejected due to her not mentioninghis name at the first instance to the police. All these witnesses have spoken of him being one of theassailants who were indulging in stone pelting, causing damage to Balmiki properties, and attackingthem with dandas and gandasis.316.2 In view of the above discussion, A-66 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.Pradeep son of Jagbir (A-63), Suresh Kumar son of Balbir (A-18), and Dalbir son of Dalip Singh(A-5)317. All three of these accused have been identified by PWs 49 and 50. However, the identification ofthese accused by PW-50 stands rejected as no mention is made of them in her statement to thepolice at the first instance. That leaves only the lone, uncorroborated testimony of PW-49 which isinsufficient to bring home their guilt in light of the decision of the Supreme Court in Masalti v. Stateof U.P. (supra). Furthermore, in his defence, A-18 has examined Suresh (DW-27) who had produceda medical certificate to prove the feasible disability of A_18 to the extent of 70%. Thus, all three ofthem stand acquitted and the appeals by the complainants and the State stand dismissed insofar asthey pertain to them.Respondents represented by Mr. Anupam Sharma318. The Court now proceeds to consider the submissions of learned counsel Mr. Anupam Sharmawho appears on behalf of the acquitted accused A-95, A-33, A-32, A-59, A-47, A-69, A-50, and A-57.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/104In brief his submissions may be summarised as follows:(i) No specific role has been attributed by any of the witnesses to any of the accused persons.(ii) Photographs of the burnt houses were not shown to the witnesses.(iii) No incriminating recoveries have been made from any of the accused persons.(iv) The forensic evidence shows that no hydrocarbons of petroleum were found present at the spotand therefore, the testimonies of the witnesses that oil was sprinkled on the houses of the Balmikisand then set on fire is not supported by the scientific evidence.(v) Inconsistencies between the statements made by witnesses to the police and their depositions inthe trial show that improvements have been made to falsely implicate the accused. In some cases,the accused have been identified for the first time only during the trial with no mention of theirname being made in the earlier statements of the witnesses.319. These contentions have already been addressed by this Court hereinbefore and it would sufficeto say at this stage that these submissions made by Mr. Sharma merit rejection for the reasonsalready recorded in this judgment. Thus, having considered the submissions made on behalf of theaccused, the Court now proceeds to consider their individual cases.A-95: Jagdish @ Jangla son of Lahna Ram @ Lakshman 320.1 He has been identified during thetrial by PWs 30, 42, and 50. However, his identification by PW-50 stands rejected as she has notnamed him in her initial statement to the police. PW-30 has identified him as one of those who wasindulging in stone pelting and attacking Balmikis with a jellie. PW-42 has named him as a memberof the rioting mob which caused damage to the properties of the Balmikis.320.2 In view of the above discussion, A-95 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.A-33: Rajinder son of Dhup Singh 321.1 In the trial, he has been identified by PWs 33 and 50.Having been named by PW-50 in her initial statement under Section 161 Cr PC, her identification ofthis accused is valid. She has made general allegations of him being a member of the rioting mobwho was attacking Balmikis and causing damage to their properties. PW-33 has also alleged that hewas indulging in stone pelting and brickbatting.321.2 In view of the above discussion, A-33 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.Ajit son of Dalip (A-32), Manbir son of Jile Singh (A-59), Balwan Singh son of Jeela (A-47), Pawanson of Rajbir (A-69), Dalbir son of Tara Chand (A-50), Kuldeep son of Om Prakash (A-57) 322.1 AsKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/105has already been discussed, the dock identification by PW-50 of witnesses who she has notpreviously named in her statement to the police at the first instance is liable to be rejected.Consequently, this Court finds that in the cases of A-32, A-47, A-69, A-50, and A-57, there is onlywitness each who seems to have identified them during the trial. In light of the discussionhereinbefore in the context of the decision in Masalti v. State of U.P. (supra), the testimony of a soleeye witness would not be sufficient to establish the guilt of an accused for membership of anunlawful assembly. Thus, the acquittals of all the aforementioned accused are upheld.322.2 In the case of A-59, his identification by PW-50 is rejected on account of her not havingnamed him at the first instance to the police. However, he has also been identified by PWs 42 and48. Both of these witnesses are reliable and have made general allegations against the accused ofbeing involved in the rioting which took place on 21st April 2010.322.3 However, the defence examined Dr. Rajesh Malik (DW-10) who brought the register of theveterinary hospital (Ex.DW-10/A) to prove that A-59 was on duty as a veterinary livestock assistanton 21st April 2010 from 8 am to 2 pm. Likewise, Jagdish (DW-11) was also examined to prove thaton that date, A-59 had gone with him to the hospital site for vaccination. The Court is satisfied thatthis accused has been able to prove his alibi and the cross examinations of the DWs examined byhim have not yielded much for the prosecution and therefore, the acquittal of A-59 is upheld.Respondents represented by Mr. M.L. Yadav323. The Court now proceeds to consider the submissions made by learned counsel Mr. M.L. Yadavwho appears on behalf of the acquitted accused A-87, A-28, A-98, A-80, A-40, A-2, A-14, and A-6.The central thrust of his arguments is that the witnesses sought to be relied upon by the prosecutionto urge findings of guilt qua the aforementioned accused are unreliable and, in many cases, haveidentified the accused for the first time in the trial. He further argues that their testimonies lackindependent corroboration and the non-conduct of a TIP would obviate the first time identificationof the accused made by the PWs. These submissions have already been addressed by this Courtearlier in this judgment and as such, they do not pass muster with this Court. That being theposition, the Court now proceeds to consider the individual cases of the acquitted accusedrepresented by Mr. Yadav.A-87: Vikas son of Sunehra @ Sumer Singh 324.1 He has been identified in the trial by PWs 49 and50 and CW-1, i.e. the family members of deceased Tara Chand and Suman. The dock identificationby PW-50 cannot be relied upon as this accused has not been named by her at the first instance inher statement to the police. PW-49 has identified him as one of those engaging in rioting, arson andcausing damage to the properties of the Balmikis. CW-1 meanwhile also alleges that he had removedhis clothes and was dancing in the gali and was part of the crowd indulging in stone pelting.324.2 An attempt was made to establish his plea of alibi by examining Dalbir (DW-28), Sajjan(DW-36) and A-87 himself as DW-29. It was sought to be proved that A-87 was present at the farmof DW-28 in Jind for the purpose of purchasing chicks for his poultry business till 6 pm on 21stApril 2010. However, as is rightly pointed out by learned SPP Ms. Richa Kapoor, his name is notKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/106mentioned in the challan which was produced by DW-28. The carbon copy of the challan does notbear the signature of A-87. This document is, therefore, not convincing at all. DW- 36 was the driverof DW-28 and tried to show that he had made delivery of the chicks to V & V Poultry Farm. In hiscross-examination, he admitted that he did not maintain any log book regarding the movement ofhis vehicle. This evidence, therefore, is of no assistance to A-87 whatsoever.324.3 In view of the above discussion, A-87 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is further noted that the conviction under Section3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction under Section 435 IPC.A-80: Satyawan son of Rajender 325.1 He has been identified by PWs 36, 42, and 50. Hisidentification by PW-50 stands rejected as she did not name him at the first instance to the police.PW-36 has accused him of indulging in stone pelting while PW-42 has accused him of sprinkling oilon the walls of PW-29s shop and setting it on fire.325.2 The defence has examined Suresh (DW-41) who has deposed that A-80 is a mechanic whoworks at his workshop in Jind and had stayed there overnight due to work pressure and thus, was inJind on the date of the incident. However, in his cross examination, he stated that he does notmaintain an attendance record or a record of employment as his workshop only has 3-4 employees.The testimony of this witness does not appear to be truthful and does little to dislodge thetestimonies of reliable PWs who have spoken to A-80s presence at the spot.325.3 In view of the above discussion, A-80 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/436 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. Seeing as the offence punishable under Section 436IPC is punishable with imprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act standsattracted.A-2: Pawan son of Ram Mehar 326.1 PWs 42, 45, 49, and 50 had identified him in Court. PW-50mentioned his name in her initial statement to the police under Section 161 Cr PC and has identifiedhim as one of those who was involved in setting fire to the house of her husband Tara Chand and haseven spoken to him beating the deceased Tara Chand with a danda before pushing him into theburning house. PW-49 too identified him as one of the assailants who set fire to the houses of theBalmikis including his own fathers. PW-45 accused A-2 of breaking into his house and causingdamage to his properties. Further, PW-42 has also named him as one of the members of the riotingmob.326.2 An attempt has been made by the defence to establish his plea of alibi by examining Virender(DW-6), a Balmiki resident of the village who has stated that the accused and him were in the fieldsof the accused since 4-4:15 am on 21st April 2010 and stayed there till evening. However, in the viewof this Court, this appears to be the deposition of a witness whose livelihood depends on the Jatcommunity which is dominant in Mirchpur. The evidence led by the prosecution remainsunhindered by such testimony. Therefore, A-2s presence in the village at the time of rioting and hisKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/107involvement in the gruesome murders of Tara Chand and Suman stands established.326.3 In view of the above discussion, A-2 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/452/436 all read with Section 149 IPC, Section 302 readwith Section 120B IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iv) and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B IPC.Seeing as the offences punishable under Sections 302 and 436 IPC are punishable withimprisonment for a term of 10 years or more, Section 3(2)(v) POA Act stands attracted.A-40: Amit son of Satyawan 327.1 He has been identified in the trial by PWs 45, 49, and 50.However, the identification of this witness by PW-50 stands rejected as no mention is made of himin her statement to the police at the first instance. PW-45 names him as one of those indulging inarson and burning of Balmiki houses. PW-49 has named him as one of the assailants who burnt thehouses of the Balmikis. His presence stands established as does his involvement in the rioting andarson of Balmiki properties.327.2 In view of the above discussion, A-40 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is further noted that the conviction under Section3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction under Section 435 IPC.A-14: Deepak @ Sonu son of Krishan @ Pappu 328.1 He was identified during the trial by PWs 38,42, 45, and 50. The identification by PW-50 is rejected as she did not name him at the first instancebefore the police. PW-38 has named this accused as one of those burning the houses of the Balmikicommunity. PW-42 speaks of seeing him with an oil container in his hand setting the houses on fire.PW-45 alleges that A-14 was part of the mob indulging in stone pelting and burning of houses.328.2 In view of the above discussion, A-14 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is further noted that the conviction under Section3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction under Section 435 IPC.A-6: Balwan son of Inder Singh 329.1 He was identified in the trial by PWs 33, 42, 48, and 50.PW-50s failure to mention this accused at the first instance to the police means that her dockidentification of this accused stands rejected. The other three witnesses have deposed to A-6indulging in stone pelting, brickbatting and membership of the rioting mob.329.2 In view of the above discussion, A-6 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427 both read with Section 149 IPC, and Section 3(1)(xv) POAAct read with Section 120B.Pradeep son of Ramphal (A-28) and Vedpal son of Dayanand (A-98)330. Both these accused have been identified by PWs 30 and 50 and in light of the rejection ofPW-50s identification of them due to her not mentioning their names to the police at the firstKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/108instance, there remains insufficient evidence for this Court to record a finding of guilt qua theseaccused in light of the decision in Masalti v. State of U.P. (supra). Their acquittals are accordinglyupheld.Respondents represented by Mr. R.P. Luthra331. The Court now proceeds to deal with the submissions of learned counsel Mr. R.P. Luthra quathe acquitted accused for whom he appears, viz. A-21, A-4, A-93, and A-7. He submits that the trialCourts judgment of acquittal does not merit interference as it extended the benefit of doubt to theaccused on account of material contradictions in witness depositions, improvements andfabrications by witnesses, dock identification of the accused and unexplained delay in recordingstatements under Section 161 Cr PC. Furthermore, he seeks to assail the witnesses testimonies bysubmitting that inconsistencies with the statements made by them to the police under Section 161 CrPC were indicative of the untrustworthiness of such testimony. He also makes reference to Ved PalTanwar, at whose farmhouse the witnesses were residing in exile when deposing in Court. Hesubmits that the possibility of witnesses being tutored or influenced for political ends cannot beruled out. The eye witness testimonies not being trustworthy, the presence of the accused at the spotdoes not stand established. For the reasons already laid down hereinbefore, the Court finds no meritin any of these submissions and thus, proceeds to consider the individual cases of the accused:A-21: Daya Singh son of Jeet Singh 332.1 He has been identified in the trial by PWs 36, 40, 42, 45,48, and 50. The dock identification of this accused by PW-50 stands rejected due to the fact that thisaccused was not mentioned to the police by her at the first instance. PW-36 has deposed to hisinvolvement in the burning of properties belonging to the Balmikis. PWs 40, 42, and 48 havespoken of his membership in the rioting mob and his indulging in stone pelting, arson and attackingthe Balmikis. PW-45 has specifically alleged that A-21 was one of those who burnt his property.332.2 In view of the above discussion, A-21 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is further noted that the conviction under Section3(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction under Section 435 IPC.A-4: Rajbir @ Nanhe son of Mai Chand 333.1 He has been identified in the trial by PWs 25, 36, 37,40, 44, and 50. PW-50 has identified this witness in her deposition in Court as well as in thestatement made by her to the police under Section 161 Cr PC and has accused him of indulging inrioting and arson. PW-25 has named his as one of the accused who was damaging properties of theBalmiki community and dancing naked on the gali. A-36 has alleged his involvement in stonepelting and damaging household properties while PW-37 has spoken of his having a danda in hishand and attacking Balmikis. PW-44, the son of PW-48, states that A-4 was sprinkling oil on hishouse before it was burnt.333.2 In view of the above discussion, A-4 hereby stands convicted for the offences punishableunder Section 147 IPC, Sections 323/427/435 all read with Section 149 IPC, and Sections 3(2)(iii)and 3(1)(xv) POA Act read with Section 120B. It is further noted that the conviction under SectionKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/1093(2)(iii) POA Act shall supercede the conviction under Section 435 IPC.Rupesh son of Tek Chand (A-93) and Satyawan son of Tara Chand (A-7)334. In the case of A-93, he has been identified by PWs 36, 38, 42, and 44. However, this Court is ofthe view that he has successfully established his alibi by examining Manoj Kumar (DW-12) who hadproduced an attendance register to show that A-93 was working as a clerk at a school in Jindbetween 7:30 am and 3 pm. Therefore, the Court upholds the acquittal of this accused by the trialCourt. In the case of A-7, he has been identified by PWs 45 and 50. However, with PW- 50 notnaming him in her initial statement to the police, the remaining testimony of PW-45 is not sufficientby itself to arrive at a finding of guilt. Thus, the acquittal of this accused is hereby upheld.Respondents represented by Mr. Jitender Sethi335. Pawan son of Hoshiar Singh (A-68), Praveen son of Jagdev (A-67), and Sandeep @ Langra sonof Amar Lal (A-75) have been represented by learned counsel Mr. Jitender Sethi and were identifiedonly by PWs 42 and 50. However, with the identification of these accused by PW-50 being rejectedas she failed to mention their name to the police at the first instance, the sole eye witness testimonyof PW-42 would not be sufficient to bring home their guilt. The acquittals of these accused aretherefore upheld.Summary of findings336. The observations and findings of this Court in the present case may be summarised as follows:(i) There is a clear causal link that exists between the incidents that occurred on 19th, 20th and 21stApril 2010 which was overlooked by the trial Court. The incident of 21st April 2010 has to be viewedin the context of the prevailing tension due to the perceived slight against the Jat community bypersons from the Balmiki community which occurred on 19 th April 2010 and then escalated.(ii) The need to exaggerate the altercation between some Balmiki boys and Rajender, Karampal andDinesh that occurred in the early hours of 21 st April 2010, as an aggravated assault indicates thesimmering tension that was prevalent in the village at the time, which was like a gunpowder kegkept waiting for a spark. This was again missed by the trial Court by seeing the incident on themorning of 21 st April 2010 as a one off incident which had nothing to do with the events of 19th and20th April 2010.(iii) Consequently, this Court is unable to subscribe to the sequence of events that has been laiddown by the trial Court or its analysis of the same in trying to shift the blame onto the Balmiki boysfor attacking members of the Jat community on the morning of 21 st April 2010, which proved to bethe spark that set off the violence that ensued on that date.(iv) From the layout of the village, it is apparent that the Balmiki basti was located in one corner ofthe village abutting fields which lay to the south and surrounded by the dwellings of the JatKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/110community on all other sides. There was no difficulty at all for the Jats to identify the Balmikihouses and attack them. In that sense, it could be said that the houses were attacked selectively. Theconclusion drawn by the trial Court with regard to the selective targeting of the houses of theBalmikis is, therefore, set aside by this Court.(v) The damage and destruction that is evidenced from the record is widespread and, in the opinionof this Court, could not have been carried by a small group of Jat youth as is speculated by the trialCourt. There is no doubt that it was indeed a mob which made a coordinated and premeditatedattack on the Balmiki basti.(vi) The conclusion of the trial Court that there was no criminal conspiracy is unsustainable in law.The trial Court failed to examine the photographs, videograph, and site plans in its analysis of theevents of 21st April 2010 and erred in accepting the alternative version of the incident on 21 st April2010 as put forth by the defence. This part of the finding of the trial Court is, therefore, set aside bythis Court.(vii) It is clear in the present case that an unlawful assembly comprising members of the Jatcommunity was formed with the common object of setting fire to the properties of the Balmikicommunity and perpetrating violence against them, as it stands established that the members ofsaid unlawful assembly came armed with stones and oil cans as well as lathis, jellies andgandasiswhich, in the present context, may be considered deadly weapons. The common object ofthe unlawful assembly was to teach the Balmiki community a lesson. Section 149 IPC is, therefore,clearly attracted.(viii) Section 3 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Orders (Amendment) Act, 1976introduced an altogether new Schedule to replace the earlier one wherein the Scheduled Castes inthe State of Haryana were also listed in Part V. The Balmiki caste is listed under Entry No.2 of PartV as a Scheduled Caste. Therefore, the offences committed against the Balmiki community attractthe POA Act.(ix) As regards the offences committed with the intention to humiliate the Balmikis that have beenadverted to by the prosecution, this Court finds that the evidence adduced in this regard is notsufficient to find any of the accused guilty of the offence under Section 3(1)(x) of the POA Act.(x) There is abundant evidence to show that at least 254 Balmiki families left Mirchpur and soughtshelter in Ved Pal Tanwars farmhouse due to the attack suffered at the hands of the Jat mob. It isthe collective act of violence by the Jats that compelled these 254 families of the Balmiki communityto leave the village. Many of them are still awaiting rehabilitation and reparation. They have beentoo scared to return. The offence under Section 3 (1) (xv) of the POA Act stands established beyondreasonable doubt and is made out qua some of the accused to whom notices have been issued in thepresent case.(xi) As regards the accused who have been held to be involved in the burning of the houses of thedeceased Tara Chand, his wife Kamala or Dhoop Singh, the offence under Section 3(2)(iv) POA ActKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/111stands attracted, whereas for those accused who have been held to be involved in the damage by firecaused to the other houses, the offence under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act stands attracted.(xii) The finding of the trial Court that this was not an instance of violence driven by caste hatred isunsustainable and is hereby set aside. The prosecution has been able to establish beyond reasonabledoubt that the offences under Section 3(1)(xv) and Section 3(2)(iii), (iv) and (v) POA Act standattracted qua some of the accused persons.(xiii) Section 8 (b) POA Act is of particular relevance in the present case since it makes specificreference to a group of persons committing an offence as a sequel to an existing dispute regardingland "or any other matter". In such a scenario, it is stipulated that the presumption is drawn asregards the common intention and prosecution of the common object. In the context of the incidentof 19th April 2010 and the incident that subsequently occurred on 21st April 2010, the presumptionunder Section 8 (b) stands attracted.(xiv) This Courts findings with respect to the POA Act and the incident of 21st April 2010 are asfollows:a) There was a deliberate targeting of the houses of the Balmikis by the Jats;b) This was an instance of caste based violence meant to teach the Balmikis a lesson for theperceived insult caused to the Jats on 19th and 21st April 2010;c) The Jats had planned their attack in advance and had come to the Balmiki basti well armed withoil cans, rehrisfilled with stones, lathis, gandasis, jellies etc.;d) The properties of the Balmikis were burnt and their belongings were damaged/destroyed as isevidenced by the photographs and videograph on record.(xv) The inconsistencies and omissions highlighted by the trial Court in rejecting the testimonies ofmultiple PWs do not materially affect the case of the prosecution. The said witnesses, as discussed,remained unshaken and were, therefore, reliable.(xvi) The mere fact that a TIP was not conducted in the present case would not vitiate thetestimonies of the witnesses who have identified the assailants in the Court. Furthermore, merelybecause a witness belongs to the Balmiki community or may be closely related to a victim does notmean that such evidence should be disregarded per se.(xvii) The disregard by the trial Court of the evidence of PWs 42 to 50 only on the ground that noneof them came forward to save the two deceased or accompany them to the hospital even though theywere related to them is an unacceptable finding. It fails to acknowledge that the situation thatexisted in Mirchpur on 21st April 2010 was such that the Balmikis were in a vulnerable position,were disoriented and paralyzed by fear. There can be no speculation about how a person shouldreact in a particular contingency. (xviii) The trial Court erred in rejecting the testimonies of the PWsKamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/112because they contradicted their statements made before the Commission of Inquiry (CoI).Statements made before a CoI are, in terms of Section 6 of the Commission of Inquiry Act,inadmissible in a trial.(xix) The trial Court erred in rejecting the testimony of the PWs with regard to the burning of housesin the Balmiki basti by the accused persons merely due to the absence of hydrocarbons of petroleumin the forensic samples and lack of corroboration by medical evidence. As the trial Court itself hasnoted, the manner in which the samples were collected was less than satisfactory, no specialist teamwas called and the extremely intricate job of collection of samples was left to a team of non-experts.(xx) A conviction may be sustained if an accused person has been named and identified by atleasttwo reliable witnesses who give a cogent and consistent account of the incident.(xxi) PW-50 is a reliable witness. As a rule of prudence as regards consistency, the testimony ofPW-50 is relied upon to the extent of the 16 accused she named in the first instance, and then again,this testimony qua these 16 has only been relied upon if corroborated by at least one other reliableeye witness.(xxii) It cannot be said in the present case that the dying declaration of the deceased Tara Chand isuncorroborated, as there is sufficient evidence in the form of the depositions of CW-1 and PWs 49and 50 as well as those of PWs 55, 64 and 68 that fully corroborate the dying declaration, which is asubstantive piece of evidence which has been relied upon to convict the accused persons.(xxiii) The incidents of 21st April 2010 constituted an act of deliberate targeting of the Balmikihouses by the Jats and setting them on fire in a pre-planned and carefully orchestrated manner. Itwas pursuant to a conspiracy by the Jats to teach the Balmikis a lesson. Tara Chand and hisdaughter Suman were set on fire and pushed inside the house in that condition in the full knowledgethat they were Balmikis. The dying declaration of Tara Chand more than adequately establishes therole of not only A-34 but also that of his associates who were identified by those present i.e. PW-49,PW-50 and CW-1. Consequently, the Court holds that the killing of Tara Chand and Suman was murder punishableunder Section 302 IPC. The judgment of the trial court that it was culpable homicide punishableunder Section 304 (II) IPC is hereby set aside.Sentences awarded337. Having convicted some of the accused persons in the manner mentioned hereinbefore, theCourt now endeavours to set out the sentences to be served by each of the convicted accused for eachof the offences for which they have been convicted. Before doing so, it would be pertinent to note theobservations of the Supreme Court in Shankar Kerba Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra AIR 1971 SC840, as under:Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/113"12. Where however the appeal is from an order of acquittal the matter is at large.There is no sentence which is binding on a person who was once an accused. Hecomes before the court with the presumption of innocence. If the court finds that theacquittal was not justified and that he was guilty of the offence with which he wascharged, it is for the appeal court to order punishment to fit the crime. If the appeal isfrom an order of acquittal with no prior order of sentence, the punishment must becommensurate with the gravity of the offence. But if the order of acquittal is precededby an order of conviction the court hearing the appeal from acquittal should notimpose a sentence greater than what the court of first instance could have imposedinasmuch as if the trial court had given him the maximum sentence which it wascompetent to give and no appeal was preferred by the accused, the State could nothave approached the High Court under any provision of the Code for enhancement ofthe sentence. The interposition of the order of an intermediate court of appeal andacquittal of the accused by it should not put the accused in a predicament worse thanthat before the trial court."338. That being the position of law, the Court proceeds to sentence the convicted accused as under:(i) For the offences punishable under Section 302 IPC and Sections 3(2)(iv) and(v) POA Act: the convict is sentenced to imprisonment for life along with payment of Rs.10,000/-fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for three months.(ii) For the offence punishable under Section 3(2)(iii) POA Act: the convict is sentenced to RI fortwo years along with payment of Rs.10,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI forthree months.(iii) For the offence punishable under Section 3(1)(xv) POA Act: the convict is sentenced to RI forone year along with payment of Rs.10,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI forthree months.(iv) For the offence punishable under Section 323 IPC: the convict is sentenced to SI for one yearalong with payment of Rs.1,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for threemonths.(v) For the offence punishable under Section 325 IPC: the convict is sentenced to RI for three yearsalong with payment of Rs.10,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for threemonths.(vi) For the offence punishable under Section 435 IPC: the convict is sentenced to RI for two yearsalong with payment of Rs.10,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for threemonths.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/114(vii) For the offence punishable under Section 436 IPC: the convict is sentenced to RI for three yearsalong with payment of Rs.10,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for threemonths.(viii) For the offence punishable under Section 427 IPC: the convict is sentenced to RI for sixmonths and payment of Rs.5,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for twomonths.(ix) For the offence punishable under Section 147 IPC: the convict is sentenced to SI for one yearalong with payment of Rs.10,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for threemonths.(x) For the offence punishable under Section 452 IPC: the convict is sentenced to RI for two yearsalong with payment of Rs.10,000/- fine and in default of payment of fine, to further SI for threemonths.(xi) All sentences are directed to run concurrently.(xii) The fine amounts collected shall be utilised by the Government of Haryana as part of theprovision of pecuniary relief and rehabilitation to the victims.Conclusion339. Therefore, in light of the findings and conclusions of this Court noted hereinabove, it is seenthat 20 accused persons previously acquitted by the trial Court now stand convicted for variousoffences under the IPC and the POA Act by this judgment while 21 acquittals have been upheld dueto there being insufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the accused. The convictions of the 13convicted accused in the present appeals have been upheld and, in certain aspects, enhanced.

Hariharan and Mr. JayantSud and learned counsel Mr. M.N. Dudeja, Ms. Sumita Kapil, Mr. Mukesh Kalia, Mr. Jitender Sethi,Mr. R.P. Luthra, Mr. Anupam Sharma, Mr. M.L. Yadav, Mr. Ajay Verma, and Mr. Sudarshan Rajan,for their excellent presentation of the case in a thoroughly competent manner and in the true spiritof the legal profession.Epilogue344. 254 families of the Balmiki community had to flee Mirchpur as a result of the violence whichthey were subjected to at the hands of the Jat community on 21st April 2010. Many of them soughtshelter in the farm house of Ved Pal Tanwar. Those families have continued to remain there as isstated by the learned SPP from whom enquiry was made in that regard. The Court also takes note ofthe fact that Writ Petition (Civil) No.211 of 2010 (Jaswant v. State of Haryana) was initially filed inthe Supreme Court of India seeking relief and rehabilitation for the displaced Dalit/Balmiki victimsas a result of the violent incident that took place in Mirchpur.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/118345. There is an order dated 10th April 2015 passed by the Supreme Court in the said case taking onrecord the enquiry report dated 24 th September 2014 of Justice Iqbal Singh (Retd.). It appears thatthis writ petition was subsequently transferred to the Punjab and Haryana High Court andregistered there as CWP No.20016 of 2015. The Court finds that the case has been adjourned fromtime to time. The last order in the case was passed on 24th July 2018, adjourning the case to 21stNovember 2018.346. There is a further order dated 9th October 2017 passed by the Punjab and Haryana High Courtnoting that according to the district authorities, "approximately 40-45 families continued to residein village Mirchpur and thereafter 33 families which had migrated from Mirchpur returned". It wasobserved that with the above families now residing in Mirchpur, there was no justification as to whythe families living at the farm house of Ved Pal Tanwar cannot reside along with the co-villagers"especially when all measures for providing adequate security have been taken by the StateGovernment".347. Be that as it may, as has been reported in news published by the Press Trust of India on 6thApril 2018, there is a proposal by the Government of Haryana to rehabilitate "254 Dalit familieswhich had migrated after two people were burnt alive in the inter-caste violence at Mirchpur villageof Hissar District eight years ago". This announcement was made by Mr. Krishan Kumar Bedi, aCabinet Minister in the Haryana Government. According to Mr. Bedi, the Chief Minister had, on 1stJanuary 2017 itself, decided to rehabilitate the victim families. The official announcement by Mr.Bedi is reported to have said that the decision had been arrived at "on the initiatives of the ChiefMinister".348. The proposal was to settle the displaced families on an 8 acre plot of land at Dhandoor villagein Hissar District from 1 st June 2018. Then there is another news report of the Tribune dated 8thJuly 2018 again stating that the Dalits of Mirchpur village would be rehabilitated "in the newlycarved town Deen Dayal Puram in Dhandoor village adjoining Hissar town". The Chief Ministerreportedly laid the foundation stone for the said township which was to come up on 8 acres alongthe Sirsa Road "to rehabilitate 258 Dalit Families of Mirchpur Village". The State Governmentproposed spending Rs.4.56 crores to lay down the infrastructure and civic facilities in the proposedtownship. The news item notes that "many of these families are presently residing in makeshiftaccommodation in a farmhouse on the outskirts of Hissar, while others have returned to their nativeMirchpur village".349. The unstated footnote to the above facts is that those who had decided to stay back at Mirchpurvillage did not support the prosecution in the present criminal trial while those who decided not toreturn are the ones who did. This in itself is a telling commentary on the fear and intimidation thatthe Dalits must still experience in Mirchpur as a result of the incidents of 19 th, 20th and 21st April2010. Also, it is a sobering fact that the Government of Haryana has sought to rehabilitate thedisplaced families not in Mirchpur but in a separate township. The question is whether this accordswith the constitutional promise of equality, social justice and fraternity assuring the dignity of theindividual.Kamala & Ors. vs State Of Nct Of Delhi & Ors on 24 August, 2018Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/123411742/119350. 71 years after Independence, instances of atrocities against Scheduled Castes by thosebelonging to dominant castes have shown no sign of abating. The incidents that took place inMirchpur between 19 th and 21st April 2010 serve as yet another grim reminder of "the completeabsence of two things in Indian society" as noted by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar when he tabled the finaldraft of the Constitution of India before the Constituent Assembly on 25th November 1949. One wasequality and the other, fraternity.351. Dr. Ambedkar highlighted the "life of contradictions" the nation would be entering into on 26thJanuary 1950 when he said, "In politics, we will be recognising the principles of one man-one voteand one vote-one value. In our social and economic life, we shall, by reason of our social andeconomic structure, continue to deny the principle of one man-one value." He asked then, asmillions of dalits including the Balmikis of Mirchpur ask even now: "How long shall we continue tolive this life of contradictions?"352. Dr. Ambedkar did not stop there but showed the way forward when he said:"Independence is no doubt a matter of joy. But let us not forget that thisindependence has thrown on us great responsibilities. By independence, we have lostthe excuse of blaming the British for anything going wrong. If hereafter things gowrong, we will have nobody to blame except ourselves. There is great danger of thingsgoing wrong. Times are fact changing. People including our own are being moved bynew ideologies. They are getting tired of Government by the people. They areprepared to have Governments for the people and are indifferent whether it isGovernment of the people and by the people. If we wish to preserve the Constitutionin which we have sought to enshrine the principle of Government of the people, forthe people, and by the people, let us resolve not to be tardy in the recognition of theevils that lie across our path and which induce people to prefer Government for thepeople to Government by the people, nor to be weak in our initiative to remove them.That is the only way to serve the country. I know of no better."S. MURALIDHAR, J.I.S.
