Briefly stated, the facts of the cases are that the assessee is a firm brought into existence by apartnership deed dt. 31st March, 1975 effective from 14th Nov., 1974. The business was carried on bythe HUF till 26th Oct., 1973. The ITO found that no partition was effected in the family before theconstitution of the firm. The ITO felt dissatisfied that there was no genuine firm. The assessee filedthe appeals before the AAC which were dismissed. The assessee then filed appeals before theTribunal which were also dismissed. Against these orders, the assessee again filed applicationsunder s. 254(2) of the Act before the Tribunal.

Likewise the applicant (CIT, Bhopal) has filed remaining four Misc. Civil Cases, particularised asabove in Set No. B, under s. 254(2) of the Act proposing two common questions, as extracted below,for our consideration and opinion :(1) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified inconfirming the order of the Dy. CIT(A) when the said order was as a result of allowing ofmiscellaneous application under s. 254(2) by the Tribunal beyond the statutory time limit ?(2) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holdingthat the Dy. CIT(A) carried out the orders of the Bench in its order dt. 10th Feb., 1989 when the saidorder was clearly out of time in terms of s. 254(2) ?5. Facts in brief concerning these four cases under Set No. B are that Dy. CIT(A) following the orderof the Tribunal passed in MA No. 1/Ind/1987 for asst. yr. 1976-77, MA No. 3/Ind/1987 for asst. yr.1977-78; MA No. 2/Ind/1987 for asst. yr. 1978-79; and MA No. 2A/Ind/1987 for asst. yr. 1979-80arising out of the orders passed in ITA Nos. 66/Ind/1981, 923/Ind/1982; 1561/Ind/1982 and1562/Ind/1982 set aside the orders of the AO and restored the issue relating to the genuineness ofthe firm to the file of AO. Aggrieved, the Department filed appeals before the Tribunal contendingthat Dy. CIT(A) has committed error and that the orders passed under s. 254(2) of the Act wereunsustainable as being barred by limitation. It was thus contended that consequential orders wereerroneous in law. The Tribunal, however, dismissed the appeals registered as ITA Nos. 584 to587/Ind/1989. The applicant then filed applications under s. 254(2) of the Act which wereregistered as RA Nos. 432 to 435/Ind/1991. These applications were rejected on 16th March, 1992.Thereafter the applicant has filed these four Misc. Civil Cases under s. 254(2) of the Act.6. Misc. Civil Case Nos. 580, 581, 584 and 585 of 1992 are filed after rejection of the applicationsregistered as RA Nos. 434, 435, 433 and 432/Ind/1991 arising out of the orders passed in MA Nos. 1,3, 2 and 2A/Ind/1987 connectible with ITA Nos. 586, 587, 585 and 584/Ind/1989 for asst. yrs.1978-79, 1979-80, 1977-78 and 1976-77 decided on 9th Sept., 1991.7. We have heard Shri D. D. Vyas, learned counsel for the applicant/Department, and Shri P.M.Choudhary, learned counsel for the non-applicant/assessee, in all these Miscellaneous Civil Cases,as particularised under Set No.A and Set No. B.8. Although four questions are presented and projected in cases marked as Set No. A, the counsel forthe applicant restricted these four cases to only question No. 3 in its reshaped and reframed form asnoted below :"Whether, on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in holding themiscellaneous applications under s. 254(2) of the IT Act, 1961 within limitation and passing theorder in favour of the assessee ?"9. Similarly in cases marked by Set No. B, two questions, as noted above, have been projected butthe counsel for the applicant restricted the same to Question No. 1 as reshaped and reformulatedCommissioner Of Income Tax vs Bhagwan Cloth Stores. on 2 April, 1996Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144673/2below :"Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was justified in upholdingthe order of the Dy. CIT(A) resting on the fulcrum of the order passed by the Tribunal under s.254(2) of the IT Act, 1961 ?"10. Shri Choudhary submitted that the questions do not arise out of the orders passed by theTribunal.11. We have considered the submissions. We find that the questions posed in the cases denoted bySet No. B depend on the validity of the orders of the Tribunal passed in regard to cases denoted bySet No. A. In cases marked by Set No. A, the question is whether the miscellaneous applicationswere filed by the assessee within the statutory period of limitation and whether the Tribunal wasjustified in passing the orders in favour of the assessee ? In cases marked by Set No. B, the questionis whether the Tribunal was justified in upholding the order of Dy. CIT(A) on the ground that heonly carried out the order of the Tribunal passed in miscellaneous applications on 10th Feb., 1989with regard to the genuineness of the firm. In other words the cases shown in Set No. B are closelylinked with cases in Set No. A.12. As we are making direction to the Tribunal, we do not deem it proper to express definite opinionon the merits of the matter but do find that the question of invocation of s. 254(2) of the Act is aquestion which needs to be heard and answered one way or the other at proper stage.13. In the circumstances, we allow these applications in part and direct the Tribunal to state thecases and refer the aforesaid reshaped and reframed questions of law with regard to four casesindicated under Set No. A and state and refer the reshaped another question, as noted above, withreference to remaining four cases indicated under Set No. B.14. These applications are thus allowed in part in terms indicated above with no order as to costs.15. The counsel fee for each side in each case is, however, fixed at Rs. 750, if certified.16. Transmit a copy of this order to the Tribunal immediately for compliance, as noted above withregard to these eight Misc. Civil Cases bearing particulars as documented above.17. We also find it fit to direct the Tribunal to make an endeavour to comply with this order within aperiod of nine months from the date of the receipt of the copy of this order.18. Retain this order in the record of Misc. Civil Case No. 139 of 1990 and place its copy each in therecord of connected Misc. Civil Cases, as particularised under Set No. A and Set No. B, for readyreference.Commissioner Of Income Tax vs Bhagwan Cloth Stores. on 2 April, 1996Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/144673/3
