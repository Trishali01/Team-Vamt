The prosecution case, as disclosed in the written report (Ext-1) of Sudhir Kumar Sinha(PW-1)lodged on 22.9.2004 at 7:00 A.M. is to the following effect:-Informant's son, Sumit Kumar aged about 13 years, on 21.9.2004 went on a bicycle to his school,BMP High School, Phulwarisharif from his house. Sunny, son of Gorakh Singh met in the school atabout 1:00 P.M. and told him that a cricket match is to be played for which a ball will be given byRavindra Singh son of Ramnath Singh and for that Sumit should accompany Sunny. Sumit left theschool with Sunny at about 1:30 P.M. He was kidnapped by Ravindra Singh and his gang with wrongmotives. When Sumit did not return to his home till about 4:00 P.M. then efforts were made tosearch him. In the night at 8:00 P.M. a station diary (sanha) was recorded. In the morning at about5:00 A.M. accused, Sunny was seen and was apprehended by the general public which informed thepolice. Sunny on being apprehended accepted his guilt and disclosed that Sumit had been murdered.Thereafter, police recovered the dead body of Sumit from the side of railway line and his school bagwas also recovered. The informant claimed that Sunny, Ravindra Singh and their gang men hadkidnapped Sumit and with a view to destroy evidence and with bad intentions they committedmurder of Sumit. On the dead body of Sumit there were marks of injury. Blood had flown from noseand ears. There were burn marks caused by cigarette and acid. Ravindra Singh and Sunny reside inAadarsh Nagar Colony where the informant resides.3. On the basis of the written report of Sudhir Kumar Sinha, Phulwarisharif P.S. Case No.649/04was instituted on 22.9.2004 at 11:15 A.M. The FIR was sent to the court and seen by learned ChiefJudicial Magistrate, Patna on 23.9.2004. The case was investigated by Anand Prakash Singh,Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/2Inspector of Police, then posted as Officer Incharge, (PW-18) and he was assisted by Sub Inspector,Arun Kumar (PW-16) who at the relevant time was posted as Sub Inspector in Phulwarisharif PoliceStation. PW-16 has admitted that in the evening of 21.9.2004 at about 8:30 while he was onpatrolling duty in the evening special mobile, he received wireless information about the missing ofSumit but no clues could be found in the evening. Next day, in the morning at about 7:00 A.M, onreceiving information from father of Sumit (Sudhir Kumar Sinha,PW-1) that residents of Mohalla(colony) had caught Sunny and were assaulting him and that Sunny had admitted the kidnapping ofSumit which had created anger amongst the people, he went with force and took Sunny in custody.After making the crowd peaceful he began to interrogate Sunny. He admitted his involvement anddisclosed that with the help of his friends he had murdered Sumit. The confession (Ext-4) wasrecorded by PW-16. As disclosed by Sunny Police went 500 yards east of Phulwarisharif station andfrom north of the railway line and about 10 yards south to boundary wall of airport, from bushes thedead body of Sumit was recovered. It was without any clothes. There were plenty of bushes allaround and ants had encroached all around the dead body. According to PW-16 he had recorded theconfession of Sunny as per directions of Officer In charge of Phulwarisharif P.S., PW-18 andparticipated in further investigation as per his orders.4. Allegedly, Sunny disclosed the names of other accused persons as miscreants involved in theoccurrence. PW-16 proved the inquest report as Ext-5, the dead body chalan as Ext-6, seizure list inrespect of school bag of Sumit as Ext-7, the confessional statement of another accused, RavindraKumar as Ext-8, the confessional statement of Santosh @ Loha as Ext- 9, the confessional statementof Ravi Chor as Ext-10, the confessional statement of Neeraj as Ext-11, station diary entry No.693dated 21.9.2004 as Ext-12 and another station diary entry No.702 dated 22.9.2004 as Ext-13. Healso identified the school bag(material exhibit 1/8) as the bag recovered on the disclosure of Sunny.He also identified the books and copies kept in the bag.5. According to PW-18, the I.O. who at the relevant time was Officer In Charge of PhulwarisharifP.S., on 22.9.2004 he received a telephonic information from the informant that persons of thecolony had apprehended Sunny on suspicion and Sunny had admitted that Sumit had beenkidnapped. On this information another station diary entry (sanha) No.702 was recorded. Aftertaking Sunny in custody and recording his confession and after recovering the dead body on hisdisclosure, PW-18 prepared the inquest report and sent the dead body for autopsy to Patna MedicalCollege Hospital. He also prepared a seizure list in respect of school bag of deceased, Sumit whichwas recovered as per disclosure made by Sunny from inside the boundary of airport.

He has also proved his signature on the confessionalstatement of accused Ravi Chor @ Ravi Rai and confessional statement of accused Neeraj asExt-10/1 and 11/1 respectively. After investigation he submitted charge sheet includingsupplementary charge sheet against the accused persons.6. After submission of charge sheet cognizance was taken by the learned Magistrate and the case wascommitted to the court of sessions. Charges were framed on 14.2.2006 to which the accused personspleaded not guilty and hence they were put on trial. The defence of the accused persons, as appearsfrom the trend of cross-examination is total denial of their involvement in the kidnapping andmurder of Sumit.7. The prosecution, in order to prove the charges examined 20 witnesses in all and also provedseveral documents such as the written report, the FIR, the confessional statement, the seizure listand the postmortem report as exhibits. In the main trial no witnesses were examined on behalf ofthe defence. Only for the purpose of enquiry in respect of claim of accused Sunny that he was ajuvenile and which plea was subsequently rejected up to the stage of this Court, some persons wereexamined as witnesses.8. As noticed earlier, PW-1, Sudhir Kumar Sinha is father of the deceased, Sumit and also theinformant of this case who gave written report (Ext-1) to the police. PW-2, Om Prakash is a witnessin respect of seizure of clothes and a tyre strip which according to him were recovered on thedisclosure made by accused, Ravindra Singh. He has proved his signature on the seizure list asExt-1/9. He has also identified accused Ravindra. PW-3, Anil Kumar Sinha is brother of PW-1 and awitness of the facts stated by PW-1 that Sumit became traceless after going to school and duringsearch the name of Sunny and Ravindra was heard and police was informed which took Sunny incustody and then he confessed his guilt and on his disclosure dead body was recovered from theplace pointed out by him. He has supported the prosecution case and has proved the signature oninquest report as Ext-1/10. He has deposed that besides Sunny Ravindra was also apprehended andon his disclosure full pant and shirt of Sumit which were tied with a tyre strip were also recoveredfor which the seizure list was prepared. He has proved his signature on the said seizure list asExt-1/11.9. PW-4, Manish Ranjan Sinha and PW-5, Sonu @ Rajive Ranjan are sons of PW-3 and cousins ofthe deceased. According to them also in course of search for Sumit on 21.9.2004 the names of Sunnyand Ravindra surfaced. They went to their houses but their family members did not discloseanything and they were not found at their houses. Next day in the early morning at about 5:00 A.M.Sunny was apprehended by the residents of colony and on their query he admitted that Sumit hadbeen kidnapped for ransom. When police came and took him in custody and made furtherinterrogation then he admitted the entire occurrence and also disclosed the names of his friends andaccomplices as Loha, Neeraj, Ravi Chor and Ravindra Singh. On the disclosure of Sunny policerecovered the dead body as well as the school bag and books of deceased, Sumit. They haveidentified the accused persons in dock. PW-6, Bittu Kumar is son of sister of PW-1, the informant.He has given the details that in course of search for Sumit he and his friends met a boy named,Ranjan who disclosed that Sunny had come to school gate during lunch time. In the colony GopalGorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/4Sharma (PW-15) another boy who was friend of Sumit disclosed that Ravindra had promised to givea ball to Sumit and had called him from school through Sunny. They went to the house of Sunnywhere his father accused, Gorakh Nath Singh gave different excuses but in the meantime youngerbrother of Sunny came out from his room and on asking he also disclosed that during lunch timeSunny had come at the school gate. In view of conflicting versions of family members of Sunny asuspicion arose about them. During search this witness and his friends also went to the house ofaccused, Ravindra but his family members also made different excuses. After some time the policehad also come to make interrogations. On 22.9.2004 Sunny was seen in the colony and wasapprehended by the residents of the colony on suspicion. On sustained interrogation he admittedthat he and his friends had kidnapped Sumit. Thereafter PW-1 gave telephonic information to thepolice which came and took Sunny in its custody. Thereafter, he has supported the prosecution caseregarding confessions by Sunny and recovery of the dead body as well as school bag and books ofdeceased Sumit as per disclosure made by Sunny. He identified the accused persons but wronglynamed Ravi Chor as Loha and Loha as Ravi Chor.10. PW-7, Baidyanath Lal is a formal witness who has admitted his signature on the inquest reportrelating to dead body of Sumit. PW-8, Girish Prasad Singh is another formal witness who has provedhis signature on the seizure list relating to school bag of Sumit containing his books and copies. Hehas deposed that the said recovery was made in his presence on the disclosure of accused Sunny.11. PW-9, Archana Sinha is wife of PW- 1 and mother of the deceased. Her statement under Section164 of the Cr.P.C. has been proved by her as Ext-2. She has in general supported the prosecutioncase regarding missing of her son, Sumit on 21.9.2004, Sunny being apprehended by people of thecolony on 22.9.2004 and his confession before the people that he with his friends had kidnappedSumit for ransom, about arrival of the police on telephonic information and about confession bySunny before the police in which he allegedly disclosed the names of the co-accused. Besides theabove she has also deposed that in the evening of 21.9.2004 at about 7:00 P.M., in course of searchfor Sumit and while going towards station she saw accused, Gorakh Singh talking to an unknownperson. She heard Gorakh Singh saying that family members of the boy are searching for himdesperately and it appears that the matter is turning serious and police may have been informed andhis name may also come into open therefore, sweep the market clean.12. PW-10, Pramod Kumar is also a young boy acquainted with the accused Ravindra and Sunny. Hehas deposed that his statement was recorded by the police and he had also given a statement in thecourt before the Magistrate disclosing that on 21.9.2004 at about 9:30 P.M. Ravindra and his friendSunny came to him. He enquired as to what was the reason for their coming. Ravindra said that hehad entered into arguments with his father. About Sunny he disclosed that he is a neighbour andthey will go back in the morning. Both of them slept at his house during the night and in themorning when he woke up he found that both of them have gone away. The witness was thereafterdeclared hostile and on cross-examination by the public prosecutor he claimed that due to fear hehad made the statement before the Magistrate that when he got up in the morning he found thatSunny had gone away and on query Ravindra disclosed that a boy had been murdered. He admittedthat he never gave in writing to any court that he is under fear or he has been put under pressure byany body. He admitted his signature on his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. The said statementGorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/5has been marked as Ext-3. He has also admitted that he had stated before the Magistrate all the factsstated in Ext-3 including the fact that in the morning he saw that Sunny had gone away and on hisenquiry Ravindra disclosed that he and Sunny had committed murder of the boy and they weretherefore hiding themselves and on knowing this fact he had turned Ravindra Kumar out of hishouse. His attention was also drawn to the facts to the aforesaid effect disclosed by him to the policeand he admitted his earlier statement in favour of the prosecution case.13. PW-11, Surendra Singh is a peon of BMP-5 High School. PW-12, Ranjan Raj, PW-13, Prem Sagarand PW-14, Pintu Kumar are students. The peon has simply stated that on 21.9.2004 during nighthours PW-12 and some other boys had come to enquire about another boy and this witness toldthem to come next day at about 10:00 when the school will be open. On 22.9.2004, he learnt thatthe missing boy had been killed and after five minutes of observing silence the school was closed.The three students have also deposed simply to the effect that they went to the school to enquireabout the missing boy and thereafter they got no knowledge about anything relating to the case.14. PW-15, Gopalji is an important witness who had, according to some of the PWs, disclosed thatSumit was called by Ravindra through Sunny for giving him cricket ball. But in court Gopalji turnedhostile. He was definitely under pressure to conceal the truth because in paragraph-1 he has gone tothe extent of saying that he does not know any boy of the name Sumit from his colony. But on beingcross- examined by the prosecution, in para-3 he has deposed that by the side of his house is thehouse of one constable (sipahiji) and the next house is of Sumit. He has also disclosed that Sumitwas also known by his alias name Lalan. He has denied the suggestion that he has deposed due tofear.15. The gist of evidence of Sub Inspector, Arun Kumar PW-16 and Inspector, Anand Prakash, PW-18has already been noticed earlier. PW-18 is the investigating officer and PW-16 had assisted him incourse of investigation. PW-17, Dr.Pankaj Kumar conducted autopsy on the dead body of deceasedSumit and has proved the postmortem report as Ext-13. From his evidence it is clear that autopsywas conducted on 22.9.2004 and he found ligature mark all around neck which had indicatedstrangulation and cause of death was asphyxia. He also found abrasion on right arm and spots of antbite marks all over the body, mostly over the chest, upper limb, interior abdominal wall and lowerlimbs. According to him those marks had been wrongly suspected as cigarette marks. According todoctor the injury on the dead body was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature anddeath had taken place within 24 hours.16. PW-19, Satyendra Singh and PW-20, Raj Kishore Rai are the Judicial Magistrates, (First Class)who have deposed that they recorded statements of Pramod Kumar PW-10 and statement ofArchana Sinha, PW-9 respectively, under Section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Thosestatements have been marked as Ext-3/1 and 2/1 respectively. From the evidence of these JudicialMagistrates, it is clear that they had taken precaution by warning the witnesses and according tothem the witnesses have given their statements voluntarily.17. Before discussing the submissions advanced on behalf of the accused persons so as to find outwhether they have been convicted rightly or not and whether it is a case fit for sentencing them toGorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/6death penalty, it will be useful to first take a bird's eye view of the evidence emerging from thestatement of witnesses noticed above.18. It is admittedly a case where there is no eyewitness and therefore no direct evidence either inrespect of kidnapping of Sumit Kumar or his killing. The circumstantial evidence on record, evenprior to detailed scrutiny and thorough examination, is only by way of-(i) Suspicion against the twoaccused, Sunny @ Sunny Deol and Ravindra Kumar @ Ravindra Kumar Singh in course of searchand their being named in the FIR lodged by PW-1 on the next day of the occurrence. (ii) Sunny wasallegedly apprehended by the residents of the colony and had confessed before them regardingkidnapping of Sumit. (iii) Confessions of accused persons except Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh NathSingh made before the police while in custody, (iv) recovery of dead body and school bag of SumitKumar on the disclosure by accused, Sunny, (v) recovery of clothes of Sumit and a tyre strip of 1 andÂ½ cubit length alleged to be weapon used for strangulation, recovered on the disclosure made byaccused, Ravindra Kumar Singh, (vi) evidence of PWs indicating that during search Sunny andRavindra were not found in their houses and its corroboration by evidence of PW- 10, PramodKumar although he has been declared hostile and (vii) evidence of Archana Sinha, PW- 9 againstaccused Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh that she over heard his conversation with an unknownperson in the late evening hours of 21.9.2004 which suggests that he was a party to the killing of thekidnapped boy at least as a conspirator.19. It requires no detailed scrutiny and reasoning to come to the conclusion that confessionsattributed to the accused persons which were allegedly made by them to the police officials whilethey were in custody are inadmissible in evidence except to the extent permitted by Section 27 of theIndian Evidence Act. On that well established principle of law the confessions of other accusedpersons except that of accused Sunny @ Sunny Deol and Ravindra Kumar Singh @ Ravindra Kumarare inadmissible in evidence. Once those confessions are left out of consideration, no legal evidenceis left on record in respect of accused Ravi Chor @ Ravi Rai, Neeraj Kumar and Santosh @ Loha.20. So far as remaining three accused are concerned, against accused Ravindra and Sunny there aremore than one circumstances but against accused, Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh the onlycircumstance is the allegation by PW-9, Archana Sinha that she, while going towards station incourse of search for Sumit saw accused, Gorakh Singh talking to an unknown person on 21.9.2004at about 7:00 P.M. She has claimed that she heard Gorakh Singh saying that since the familymembers of the boy are desperately searching for him (boy) and since the matter is turning seriousand the police may have been informed and there was likelihood of his name being disclosed, hencethe market should be swept clean. This kind of statement, according to prosecution was in relationto the missing boy, Sumit and cleaning the market impliedly meant killing Sumit. She has furtherclaimed that these facts were conveyed by her to her husband (PW-1) at about 11:00 P.M. in thenight. There is no witness to support such a claim of PW-9 and no other material to prove the chargethat accused Gorakh Singh was in conspiracy with the other accused persons in the matter ofkidnapping and killing of Sumit. The evidence of PW-1 shows that he has not supported theaforesaid claim of PW-9 that she disclosed to him the alleged utterances of Gorakh Singh whiletalking to any person. No such facts were disclosed by PW-1 even in the Sanha, Ext-13 lodged on22.9.2004 or in the first information report. Such uncorroborated claim of PW-9 which is the onlyGorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/7evidence against accused, Gorakh Singh is clearly not sufficient to establish the charges against him.21. So far as the case against accused Sunny & Ravindra Kumar is concerned, it has been noticedearlier that they are named in the FIR lodged soon after arrest and confession of Sunny and recoveryof the dead body and school bag of the deceased Sumit. The most important circumstance againstthese two appellants is their alleged disclosure before the police which fact has been corroborated bywitnesses and which resulted in recovery of dead body and school bag of deceased, Sumit on thedisclosure by accused Sunny and recovery of clothes of Sumit and a tyre strip of 1 and Â½ cubitlength on the disclosure by accused Ravindra Kumar Singh. The other circumstance is the factemerging from the evidence of several PWs indicating that during search for Sumit they went to thehouse of Sunny and Ravindra but they were not in their houses. It is also clear from the evidence ofPW-10, Pramod Kumar although he has been declared hostile, that on 21.9.2004 at 9:30 P.M.Ravindra and Sunny had gone to his house and they spent the night at his house. He has alsoadmitted that he had given a statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. before a Magistrate which iscontained in Ext-3. According to that statement and as per statement of the I.O. PW-18 inparagraph-2 of his deposition, this witness had disclosed that Ravindra and Sunny had come to hishouse on the relevant date at about 9:30 P.M. and they stayed in his house. In the morning he foundthat Sunny had left and on enquiry Ravindra disclosed that he, Sunny and some others had killedthe boy. The evidence of the Magistrate, PW-19 Satyendra Singh confirms that PW-10, PramodKumar had given his statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. voluntarily. The Magistrate has deposedthat before recording the statement he had pointed out that it could be used also against him and hehad also tested that person was ready to make statement voluntarily. The Magistrate has furtherdeposed that Pramod Kumar did not make any complaint before him that he was making thestatement under pressure of anyone. In paragraph-2 of his deposition PW-10 has admitted that henever gave in writing to the court that he was in fear of anyone or he had been pressurized byanyone. In paragraph-1 he has no doubt given an explanation that he had deposed before theMagistrate out of fear that when he got up in the morning he found that Sunny had gone away andon enquiry Ravindra disclosed about the murder of a boy. Such explanation in respect of statementbefore the Magistrate does not appear to be convincing in view of evidence of the Magistrate, PW-19.Moreover, no such explanation has been given for his statement before the police about which hehas admitted in paragraph-5 of his deposition that he stated before the police that on enquiry in themorning Ravindra disclosed that in the night he and Sunny had committed murder of a boy.             22.      Simply       because     PW-10      has    beendeclared      hostile     and       cross-examined         by     theprosecution, his evidence in court does not lose its value. His admission about his earlier statementbefore the police in Paragraph-5 came out in course of cross-examination by the prosecution and itis supported by the evidence of the I.O., PW-18. This part of evidence of PW- 10 is clearly reliableand can be used against the appellant, Ravindra. Since the aforesaid part of evidence of PW-10 isfound reliable it flows from the same that accused, Ravindra had made an extra judicial confessionbefore PW-10 that he and the co-accused, Sunny who has been tried together had committedmurder of the boy in the night of 21.9.2004 and thereafter instead of remaining in their houses,Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/8obviously for the purpose of hiding themselves, they spent the night in the house of PW-10.23. The extra judicial confession of accused, Ravindra proved through PW-10 may also be taken intoconsideration against Sunny in view of Section 30 of the Evidence Act, although with great cautiononly for seeking assurance for the inference which may arise from other circumstances appearingagainst him. The position would have been different, had the confession of Ravindra beenexculpatory but that is not the situation here. From the evidence of PW-10 noticed above it is clearthat the confession of Ravindar Kumar before PW-10, as corroborated by Ext-3, the statement underSection 164 Cr.P.C. and by the I.O. PW-18 disclosing the earlier statement of PW-10 made beforehim, was voluntary and inculpatory.              24.              Learned          counsel         for      theappellants,         Ravindra        and        Sunny     has    submittedthat    the     prosecution             evidence       that    Sunny    wasapprehended by persons of the colony and before them he confessed that he with his friends hadkidnapped Sumit is not reliable because such people of the colony have not been named and theadmission of the I.O. that there were injuries on the person of Sunny for which he was sent formedical examination also shows that such confession could at best be under coercion and threat.The aforesaid submission appears to have merit and in that view of the matter the aforesaidconfession of Sunny allegedly made before the people of the colony cannot be accepted as avoluntary confession and hence it is inadmissible in view of Section 24 of the Evidence Act.25. It was next contended on behalf of the aforesaid two accused persons that from admission of theI.O. made in paragraph-29 of his deposition it is clear that the dead body of Sumit was recoveredfrom a place within the jurisdiction of Gardanibagh Police Station. Further, on the basis ofsuggestion to the I.O. that the dead body was recovered by police of that police station and that inher statement under Section 164 Cr.P.C. PW-9, Archana Sinha, the mother of the deceased indicatedthe time of recovery of the dead body as 7:30 or 8:00 in the morning, it was submitted that there issome discrepancy regarding the time of recovery of the dead body and since it was recovered from aplace under different police station hence the prosecution case of recovery of the dead body on thebasis of arrest and confession of accused, Sunny is doubtful and such claim should be rejected assuch. However, on a careful perusal of the FIR, the inquest report which was prepared on 22.9.2004at 8:30 A.M. and the evidence of witnesses it is found that there is no material contradiction and theprosecution case cannot be doubted that in the morning of 22.9.2004 Sunny was taken into custodyby the police and on his disclosure made to the police in presence of witnesses, the dead body andthe school bag of deceased, Sumit was recovered by the police.26. It was further submitted on behalf of the aforesaid two accused that prosecution has not provedthat the I.O. obtained a written permission for entering into premises of airport for recovery ofschool bag and articles belonging to the deceased, Sumit. No doubt, the I.O. has admitted that he didnot obtain permission from the authorities of the airport in course of investigation but this factGorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/9alone is not sufficient to raise doubt regarding recovery of school bag of deceased Sumit along withbooks and copies which have been made material exhibits, and also in respect of recovery of clothesof Sumit along with a tyre strip. Both the recoveries are supported by seizure lists which have beenproved by witnesses. The conduct of the I.O. in gaining entry into the airport without obtainingpermission of the competent authority, at least in writing, can have several plausible explanationsincluding reluctance of the Guards at the airport to interfere with the police investigation. On thisaccount alone the factum of recovery of incriminating articles on the basis of disclosure made byaccused Sunny and Ravindra cannot be disbelieved.            27.                  Learned        counsel      for       theappellants,           Sunny        and    Ravindra       referred          toseveral     judgments            including       the      judgment         ofPrivy      Council         reported        in    AIR     1947    P.C.67(Kottaya Vs.Emperor) to submit that only those words given out by the accused to the police areadmissible in evidence under Section 27 of the Evidence Act which directly and distinctly relate tothe relevant facts discovered as a consequence of such disclosure. The other part of statement of theaccused before the police which do not relate to the discovery of relevant facts are inadmissible.28. The law relating to Section 27 of the Evidence Act is no longer under any confusion. Throughcatena of judgments including a recent judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Anil Vs.Administration of Daman and Diu, Daman, reported in (2008)1 SCC (Cri) 72 it is well recognizedthat Section 27 is by way of exception to Section 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act and it makesadmissible only so much of information given by an accused in police custody as relates distinctly tothe facts thereby discovered. It is also now settled that the fact discovered embraces the place fromwhich the object is produced as well as the knowledge of the accused and not only to the materialobjects found at the place disclosed by the accused.29. While keeping the aforesaid law in mind and also the admitted legal position that the fact ofdisclosure leading to recovery of incriminating facts alone is not sufficient for conviction as held by abench of this Court in a recent judgment in the case of State of Bihar Vs. Diwakar Mehta, 2008(3)PLJR 118 to which one of us (Shiva Kirti Singh,J.) was a party, we have analyzed all the facts andcircumstances and found that against the FIR named appellants, Sunny and Ravindra Kumar theprosecution has succeeded in proving the following circumstances:-(i) In the night of the occurrence i.e. 21.9.2004 in course of search of the deceased, Sumit, they werenot at their houses.(ii) Both the said accused had taken unusual step of staying in that night at the house of PW-10.(iii) Accused Ravindra had made extra judicial confession before PW-10 which was inculpatory innature to the effect that he and Sunny had committed murder of a boy in that night before takingGorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/10shelter in the house of PW-10.(iv) While in custody of police accused, Sunny made disclosures which lead to discovery of deadbody and school bag of deceased, Sumit found concealed amongst bushes.(v) While in police custody accused, Ravindra made disclosures leading to recovery of clothes ofdeceased, Sumit along with a tyre strip of 1 and Â½ cubit, alleged to be used for strangulating thedeceased.30. The aforesaid facts coupled with lack of any explanation by the said two accused as to how theycould know the facts disclosed by them leading to recovery of incriminating materials, in my vieware sufficient to establish the charge under Section 302 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Codeagainst appellants Sunny @ Sunny Deol and Ravindra Kumar @ Ravindra Kumar Singh beyond anyreasonable doubts. However, the charge of kidnapping for ransom or conspiracy has not beenproved beyond reasonable doubts.31. On behalf of the appellant Sunny, argument was advanced that his plea of being a juvenile on thedate of occurrence has been wrongly disallowed by the trial court although he had examined somewitnesses including himself in course of enquiry for that purpose. It has been submitted that onaccount of Section-7A of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 which hasbeen introduced through Amendment Act, 2006 w.e.f. 22.8.2006, the claim of juvenility can beraised before any court at ant stage and after determining such claim in terms of provisionscontained in Act of 2000 and the rules made thereunder, even in the case of a juvenile who hasceased to be so, the sentence passed against a person who is found to be a juvenile on the date ofcommission of the offence must be declared to have no effect.32. The aforesaid plea suffers from a factual fallacy. No doubt, under law as amended throughSection-7A, now it has been recognized through the statute that a claim of juvenility may be raisedbefore any court at any stage but that does not mean that such a claim which has been raised beforethe competent court and decided against the accused on facts, can again be raised although theearlier finding that appellant, Sunny Deol was not a juvenile under the Act of 2000 has alreadyattained finality on account of dismissal of his criminal revision bearing No.471/07 dismissed by thisCourt on 16.5.2007. Learned counsel for the State has rightly placed reliance upon the judgment ofthe Supreme Court in the case of Sidharth Vs.State of Bihar, (2006)1 SCC 175 in paragraph-9whereof the Supreme Court has held that since at the earlier stage the accused had failed in hischallenge to the finding that he was not a juvenile, again before the Supreme Court he could notchallenge that finding because the decision on that issue had become conclusive and final. Hence, inthe facts of the case, this Court has no option but to hold that since appellant, Sunny could notsucceed even before this Court in challenging the finding of the trial court that he was not a juvenileand therefore not entitled to protection of the Juvenile Justice Act of 2000, such plea cannot bepermitted to be raised by the appellant again before this Court in the present proceeding.Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh & ... vs State Of Bihar on 3 September, 2008Indian Kanoon - http://indiankanoon.org/doc/75274796/1133. Coming to the question of sentence, I have considered all the facts and circumstances and I haveno hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the offence in question cannot be treated as rarest ofrare and therefore award of death penalty to appellant, Sunny @ Sunny Deol and appellant,Ravindra Kumar @ Ravindra Kumar Singh is found to be not in accordance with law. In view ofearlier discussions and findings these two accused are found guilty of the charge under Section302/34 of the IPC and their conviction for such charge is affirmed. As discussed above it is not arare case deserving award to extreme penalty of death and hence the award of death penalty to thesetwo appellants is not found appropriate. For the charge found approved against them, the ends ofjustice would be satisfied by awarding them life imprisonment.34. As a result of discussions and findings given earlier the other four accused persons, namely, RaviChor @ Ravi Rai, Neeraj Kumar, Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath Singh and Santosh @ Loha areacquitted of all the charges. Accordingly, the death reference against them is answered in negative.Their appeals stand allowed. The appeals of appellant, Sunny @ Sunny Deol and Ravindra Kumar @Ravindra Kumar Singh are allowed in part but dismissed in respect of their conviction under Section302 read with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code. As discussed, the death penalty awarded to themis commuted to life imprisonment. The death reference in respect of them is also answered innegative. As a result of their acquittal of all the charges, the appellants, Ravi Chor @ Ravi Rai,Neeraj Kumar, Gorakh Singh @ Gorakh Nath singh and Santosh @ Loha are directed to be releasedfrom custody forthwith if they are not required in connection with any other case.(Shiva Kirti Singh,J.)
